## Goal

> Make my life easier when setting up a machine.

## Prerequisites on an Ubuntu based machine

```bash
# Add Ansible and Git
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible git software-properties-common
```

## Prerequisites on an Arch based machine

```bash
# Add Ansible and Git
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S ansible git

# Add ansible AUR module
git clone https://github.com/kewlfft/ansible-aur.git ~/.ansible/plugins/modules/aur
```

## Setup an Ubuntu or Arch based machine

```bash
# Get the dotfiles
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cumpsd/dotfiles.git <your preferred location>/dotfiles
cd <your preferred location>/dotfiles

# Link as much as we can already
./install base

# On Ubuntu, also run:
sudo ./install ubuntu

# On WSL, also run:
sudo ./install wsl

# Do an initial run which sets up a lot of dependencies
pushd ansible > /dev/null
ansible-playbook -K -i inventory system.yml
popd > /dev/null

# Install git-crypt
mkdir /tmp/git-crypt
tar -xzf git/git-crypt-0.6.0.tar.gz -C /tmp/git-crypt --strip 1
cd /tmp/git-crypt
make
sudo cp git-crypt /usr/local/bin/

# Import our existing GPG keys
gpg2 --import <key>

# Trust our imported key
gpg --edit-key user@domain.com

gpg> trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
And don't forget to save the changes:

gpg> save

# Unlock the repo and setup the system
git-crypt unlock
./setup-system

# If you want all .NET Core versions, also run:
sudo ./install dotnet

# Use SSH for remote
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cumpsd/dotfiles.git

# At this point, it might be needed to explicitly run fisher and Oh My Fish! to get our shell setup
fisher
omf install
```

## Post Install steps on WSL

### Change Console to Solarized Dark

```bash
# Setup WSL specific tweaks
./setup-wsl
```

### Windows Font Install

- Download [Nerd Fonts Hack](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v1.2.0/Hack.zip)
- Extract and install the required fonts (everything which ends with `Complete Mono Windows Compatible.ttf`)
- Set default console font to Hack NF, 14

## More configuration sync

### VS Code

- Install `shan.code-settings-sync`
- Press `Shift + Alt + D` it will ask your GitHub Gist ID.
- All VS Code settings are getting synced, whenever you change something you can upload them with `Shift + Alt + U` or turn on Auto-Upload with `Sync : Advanced Options > Toggle Auto-Upload on Settings Change`
- More info at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync

## Troubleshooting

### PIP Errors

If the task `[pip : Ensure pip_install_packages are installed.]` is throwing errors looking like:

```plain
stderr: Traceback (most recent call last):
File \"/home/cumpsd/.local/bin/pip2\", line 7, in <module>
from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main\
```

You can fix it by running `python -m pip uninstall pip` and then executing `~/.dotfiles/setup-system` again.
