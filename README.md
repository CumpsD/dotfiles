gpg> trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
And don't forget to save the changes:

gpg> save
```

## Post Install steps on WSL

### Font Install

## Troubleshooting

### PIP Errors

If the task `[pip : Ensure pip_install_packages are installed.]` is throwing errors looking like:

```
stderr: Traceback (most recent call last):
File \"/home/cumpsd/.local/bin/pip2\", line 7, in <module>
from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name main\
```

You can fix it by running `python -m pip uninstall pip` and then executing `~/.dotfiles/setup-system` again.

### ebtables on WSL with Ubuntu 18.04

When doing an `apt-get dist-upgrade` on Ubuntu Bionic, it will fail on `ebtables` due to https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3274

You can fix it by running `sudo apt-mark hold ebtables` and then executing `~/.dotfiles/setup-system` again.
