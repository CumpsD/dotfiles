  <h1>GPG Tutorial</h1>
  <p>
   This was once just a page that contained my public encryption key.  It has
   now grown to become an introduction to how and why to use the GNU Privacy
   Guard encryption software (GPG) to protect your privacy.  It is continually
   growing.  If you have questions, corrections, suggestions, software
   recommendations, or want to exchange encrypted e-mails, please contact <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">Alan Eliasen</a>.  I'm also on the
   Twitter thingy as <a href="https://twitter.com/aeliasen">aeliasen</a>. Thanks!

  <h2><a name="PublicKey">Public Key for Alan Eliasen</a></h2>
  <p>
   Below is the public encryption key for Alan Eliasen,
   (<a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">eliasen@mindspring.com</a>) in
   armored OpenPGP format.  This lets you write encrypted messages that only I
   can read!
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b>  I have recently upgraded to a stronger 4096-bit RSA key.
   If you were previously using the old key, please see my <a href="https://futureboy.us/gpgmigration.txt">key migration document</a> for more information on
   the reasons for this change and how to migrate to the new key.
  </p>

  <p>
   Don't worry:  you don't have to read this.  You can cut-and-paste it or
   obtain it in a <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.txt">plaintext file</a> or import it from a
   keyserver using the directions in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ImportingAKey">Importing a
    Key</a> section of this document.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="PublicKeyCrypto">What is Public-Key Cryptography?</a></h2>
  <p>
   In short, public-key cryptography solves the age-old problem "how do I
   communicate with someone securely without somehow exchanging a secret
   password first?"  Exchanging a shared password securely is a hard problem.
   You may have no way to do so if your communications are monitored.
  </p>

  <p>
   With public-key encryption, instead of sharing a password, each party
   generates a "keypair" consisting of a "public" key and a "secret/private"
   key.  Each party can then publish their "public" key to the world or send
   it directly to the other party, while keeping their secret key private and
   safe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have Person B's public key, you can do a few things with it:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Encrypt a message that only that Person B can decrypt.  (They need their
    secret key to decrypt it.)
      
   </li><li>Validate that Person B signed a message with their secret key. This
    also lets you verify strongly that the message was not corrupted nor
    modified in transmission.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
    With your secret key, you can do a few things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Decrypt messages encrypted with your public key.

    </li><li>Sign messages that others can verify came from you (they need your
      public key to verify the signature.)
  </li></ul>
    
  <h2><a name="WhatIUse">What I Use</a></h2>
  <p>
   I accept and transmit all messages using the OpenPGP format, which is an
   open standard, (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt">RFC 4880</a>)
   and the most widely used standard for public encryption, so communication
   should work with any OpenPGP-compatible program.
  </p>

  <p>
   For encryption and signing of e-mail (on Windows, Linux, and Mac) you can
   use a combination of:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a> (GPG)

   </li><li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>,
    mozilla.org's stand-alone mail client.

   </li><li>The Mozilla <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/">Enigmail</a> add-on.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   If you're on Fedora, you will have infinitely better luck installing
   Enigmail from the Fedora distribution rather than obtaining the plug-in
   elsewhere.  Install all three packages it by doing the following as root:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>dnf install gnupg thunderbird thunderbird-enigmail</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   After installing or updating in Fedora, you may not see the OpenPGP menus
   in Thunderbird until going to <code>Tools | Add-ons</code> and then
   disabling Enigmail, restarting Thunderbird, re-enabling Enigmail, and
   restarting Thunderbird.
  </p>

  <p>
   My main gripe is that Thunderbird changes version numbers rapidly and
   Enigmail sometimes doesn't keep up, which makes Enigmail claim that it's
   incompatible with your Fedora version.  This is an important reason to use
   a package-manager like <code>dnf</code> on Fedora which tends to keep them
   in sync.  This is another reason it's good to know how to use the gpg
   executable manually.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first thing you want to do in Enigmail is to make all of its settings
    visible. You can do this from the menu items <code>Enigmail | Preferences |
      Display Expert Settings and Menus</code>.  The basic settings are
   inadequate.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> As of the latest update of Enigmail, around July 2014, the
   text used in several menu items has changed.  The old top-level menu item
   was called <code>OpenPGP</code> and the new one is called
   <code>Enigmail</code>.  You may need to mentally correct these examples if
   you're using an old version of Enigmail.
  </p>

  <p>
   In Enigmail, I've had the best luck setting the keyserver to default to
   <code class="input">pgp.mit.edu</code>, but this may no longer be necessary
   as it now contains a list of default keyservers which are more stable than
   they used to be.  (But often still down.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The Gnu Privacy Guard <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#email_clients">FAQ</a> lists
   some of the other e-mail programs compatible with GPG.  Note that you can
   use <em>any</em> e-mail program (that doesn't corrupt messages) along with
   the <code>gpg</code> executable on the command-line.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   For Macintosh, you can obtain GPG from the <a href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPGTools</a> website.  (I haven't personally
   used these, but others have recommended them.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Alternately, I sometimes use the <code>pgg</code> package in Emacs/XEmacs
   which is a wrapper around the <code>gpg</code> executable's functions.  You
   can do something like highlight a region and do:
   <code>M-x&nbsp;pgg-encrypt-region</code> and encrypt directly within your
   documents.
  </p>

  <p>
   For encrypting files, or doing anything more interesting, I just use the
   <code>gpg</code> program on the command-line.  If you're security-paranoid,
   the fewer executables, the better.  Most of this document teaches you the
   fun and important things you can do with the <code>gpg</code> program to be
   secure.

  <p>
   The developers of the Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9">K-9
   Mail</a> application recommend "Install the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain">OpenKeyChain:
   EasyPGP</a> to encrypt/decrypt your emails using OpenPGP."  Although I use
   K-9 Mail, I have not tried OpenKeyChain and I can not vouch for it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   On Android, you may want to experiment with <a href="https://r2mail2.com/">R2Mail2</a>.  I haven't used it and can't vouch
   for it.
  </p>

  <p>
   There is also <strike>Android Privacy Guard (APG)</strike> (no longer
   linked here; see below), which integrates with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9&amp;hl=en">K-9 Mail</a>
   program, but I do not vouch for it.  APG was not updated for several years,
   but has seen activity more recently.  <b>Warning</b>: This is why I don't
   trust APG.  If I were some corrupt actor, I would look for some
   cryptography package that nobody has updated for a long time and offer them
   a bunch of money to buy out and corrupt and back-door their package.  This
   is <em>exactly</em> the model of a product I wouldn't trust.
  </p>
   
  <h2><a name="gpgorgpg2">gpg or gpg2 ?</a></h2>
  <p>
   GPG version 2 may be on your system with the executable name
   <code>gpg2</code> .  Either executable can be used for these
   demonstrations.  Both are very compatible with each other.  (If you want to
   know a million different opinions on which you should be using, do a web
   search.)  Version 1 is more tested, and is usually a single monolithic
   executable.  Version 2 is compiled with crypto libraries like
   <code>libgcrypt</code> externally linked, and is designed to work better
   with external password entry tools.  That is, <code>gpg2</code> is designed
   for graphical environments, while <code>gpg</code> works better for
   automated and command-line use.  From the command-line, I use version 1.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
   <p><b>Update March 2017:</b> <code>gpg2</code> contains elliptic-curve
   algorithms for generating and importing public keys.  (These might show up
    as "<code>ECDH, ECDSA, EDDSA</code>" when you run
    <code>gpg2&nbsp;--version</code></p>

   <p>
    These elliptic-curve algorithms are not contained in <code>gpg</code>.  If
    you attempt to communicate with people who only have elliptic-curve
    algorithm public keys, you will not be able to import their public keys
    with <code>gpg</code>, and you may need to use <code>gpg2</code>.
   </p>

   <p>
    In general, it is believed that elliptic curve algorithms require shorter
    keys for the same level of security as, say, RSA keys.  I will go out on a
    very solid limb and say that the length of keys is not very important in
    the contexts where GPG is used, because a public key is only imported
    once, and the length of the key in this context matters very little. Nor
    does the time taken to decrypt an e-mail.  (Key length only really matters
    when you're contacting, say, lots of websites and milliseconds and
    hundreds of bytes matter.) If it takes even a few seconds to decrypt, it's
    usually not important in the context of GPG.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The only important factor is security.  I do not vouch for the security of
    elliptical curves over integer factorization over discrete logarithm
    calculations.  A breakthrough in any of these fields can render any
    superiority moot (let it be noted that many, many smart people have
    studied factorization and discrete logarithm problems longer than they
    have studied elliptic curves and have not made any significant
    <em>published</em> breaks over numbers of the appropriate size.)
   </p>

   <p>
    Some people may only publish their public keys using elliptical curve
    algorithms which are only usable with new versions of <code>gpg2</code>.
    They are almost always smarter than me or you (but history may not prove
    them right.)
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
   <p><b>Update October 2015:</b>  I have now seen cases where <code>gpg</code>
   cannot import keys from some clients, notably keys sent by <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/" target="_blank">Mailvelope</a> (link
   opens in new window,) a client that helps you use encryption with web-based
   e-mail services like GMail or Yahoo.  When importing the key, the error
   message may look something like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg: assuming bad signature from key BACD0190 due to an unknown critical bit<br>
gpg: key BACD0190: no valid user IDs<br>
    gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature<br>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In this case, the <code>gpg</code> executable is telling you that it
   doesn't understand some of the subpackets sent in the message, and,
   according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.1">OpenPGP
    specification, (RFC 4880 Section 5.2.3.1)</a>, <code>gpg</code> is correct
   in treating the signature as invalid if it doesn't understand the subpacket
   type:
  </p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     'Bit 7 of the subpacket type is the "critical" bit.  If set, it
     denotes that the subpacket is one that is critical for the evaluator
     of the signature to recognize.  If a subpacket is encountered that is
     marked critical but is unknown to the evaluating software, the
     evaluator SHOULD consider the signature to be in error.'
    </p>

    <p>
     'An evaluator may "recognize" a subpacket, but not implement it.  The
     purpose of the critical bit is to allow the signer to tell an
     evaluator that it would prefer a new, unknown feature to generate an
     error [rather] than be ignored.'
    </p>
  </blockquote>

   <p>
    If you encounter this case, then <code>gpg</code> likely did <em>not</em>
    import the public key correctly, and you will need to try to use
    <code>gpg2</code> to import the public key.  (For me, <code>gpg2</code>
    could import public keys that <code>gpg</code> could not.)  It appears
    that, once you have correctly imported the public key, you may be able to
    use <code>gpg</code> or <code>gpg2</code> to communicate with the other
    party, depending on the particular feature that was requested.
   </p>

   <p>
    By the way, at this point, I neither endorse nor discourage use of
    Mailvelope.  I have used it to apparently encrypt communications correctly
    with GMail users, though.

  </div>
  
  <h2><a name="ImportingAKey">Importing A Key</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="ImportingFromEnigmail">Importing From Enigmail</a></h3>
  <p>
    The simplest way to import my key from an e-mail client (like Enigmail) is
    to import it from a keyserver.  In Enigmail, you can search for keys using
    the menu items <code>Enigmail | Key Management | Keyserver | Search for
    Keys</code>, and then searching for my name or my e-mail
    address <code>eliasen@mindspring.com</code> or my key ID, which is
    <code>5F2B4756ED873D23</code> or the shorter <code>ED873D23</code>.  Then
    select its checkbox from the list and click "OK."
  </p>

  <p>
    A lazier and more dangerous way to import my public key from Enigmail is
    to try and send me an encrypted e-mail.  (When composing a message, choose
    the menu item <code>Enigmail</code> and select both <code>Sign
    Message</code> and <code>Encrypt message</code>.)  Then, when you try to
    send, Enigmail will realize that it doesn't have my public key, and will
    bring up the Key Management window.  From there, you can
    choose <code>Download Missing Keys</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Another way to import my key is to e-mail
   <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.txt">the plaintext version of my key</a> to your own e-mail
   address and choose the option like "Import PGP Key."
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ImportingFromGPG">Importing From GPG</a></h3>
  <p>
   If your e-mail client doesn't allow automatic import of keys from an e-mail
   message, you will need to save the plaintext file listed above key to a
   file, then import the key manually.  From GNU Privacy Guard, this is:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --import <i>[filename]</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
    My key is available from <code>pgp.mit.edu</code> (all the major
    keyservers mirror each other, so you could probably get it from the
    keyserver of your choice, but this one seems to be pretty reliable.)
  </p>

  <p>
    You can browse the keys available on keyservers
    at <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">pgp.mit.edu</a> or the
    often-slow <a href="https://sks-keyservers.net/">sks-keyservers.net</a>.
    Who do you know who has a posted public key?
  </p>

  <p>
   From GNU Privacy Guard, you could import my key using the following (but
   read on to be more secure.)
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --search-keys eliasen@mindspring.com</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that in all of these examples, whenever you see an e-mail address,
    you can usually substitute part of a name or part of an e-mail address, or
    a key ID.  Most of these commands perform a substring search.
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, even more directly, my full key fingerprint is
   <code>EC2392F2EDE74488680DA3CF5F2B4756ED873D23</code>, (it's more common
   but less secure to use the last 16 or 8 characters of a key, so
   <code>ED873D23</code> will work too. (Note that the shorter key IDs are
   just the last 16 or 8 characters of the fingerprint!)  Read the technical
   note on <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ShortKeyID">Short Key IDs</a> below for interesting
   attack ideas using short keys.)  The following gpg command will import my
   key from a keyserver, using my full fingerprint (you can also use the last
   8 or 16 hexadecimal digits of the fingerprint as the short or long key
   IDs.)  You may need to prepend <code>0x</code> to the fingerprint in some
   versions of GPG, or when using the key ID with the
   <code>--search-keys</code> option.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys EC2392F2EDE74488680DA3CF5F2B4756ED873D23</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Read on, though, and see why just importing some key off a keyserver isn't
   enough to be sure that you're talking with <em>me</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
   You may not have to specify a keyserver in the lines above.  Later versions
   of GPG have a more reliable keyserver list built in.
  </p>

  <p>
   <a href="https://sks-keyservers.net/status/">sks-keyservers.net</a> monitors
   the status of keyservers in real-time.  (But it's often down.)  If you're
   having trouble importing signatures from a specific keyserver, or want a
   list of available keyservers, you might want to look there.

  <h2><a name="GettingHelp">Getting Help</a></h2>
  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --help</code>
  </p><p>

  </p><p>is your friend.  It will list the most common options to GPG (but not all
   of them.)  Other complete documents are available:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals.en.html">GPG
     Manual</a>

     GNU Privacy Guard</a> 
   </li><li><a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html">The GNU Privacy Handbook</a>
  </li></ul>


  <h2><a name="GettingStarted">Getting Started</a></h2>
  <p>
   I long resisted the temptation to give an overly-simplified "Getting
   Started" section here because that may falsely lead you to believe that
   you're being secure.  As this document has expanded greatly, it's becoming
   a better guide.  However, the best way to get started with encryption is to
   go to the home site for <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy
   Guard</a> and read the "GNU Privacy Handbook" (available in lots of formats
   and languages) under the "Guides" section.  This will walk you through
   setting up GPG on your system, including creating your secret keys.
  </p>

  <p>
   Creating your secret key will start with:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --gen-key</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You should probably use the default settings, except it doesn't hurt to
   make the key size as large as allowed (4096 bits currently.)  The larger
   the key size, the longer it will take to initially generate your key (and
   encryption/decryption will be slightly slower.  That is a Good Thing, as
   anyone attempting to break your encryption will also need to spend more
   time too.)
  </p>

  <h2><a name="RevocationKey">Generating a Revocation Key</a></h2>
  <p>
   After generating your key, one of the first things you should do is create
   a revocation certificate:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --gen-revoke --armor --output=RevocationCertificate.asc <i>your@email.address</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This certificate can be used to revoke your key if it is ever lost or
   compromised.  <em>Do not neglect this step!</em> Print it out, save it on a
   disk, and store it safely.  It will be short enough that you can type it
   back in by hand without much effort if you just print it out.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you lose your secret key or it is compromised, you will want to revoke
   your key by uploading the revocation certificate to a public keyserver
   (assuming you uploaded your public key to a public keyserver in the first
   place.  See below.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If you have multiple unrevoked public keys and you have messages that say
   something like "I lost that one, this new key supersedes the other ones,"
   (and I've seen this from people who like to claim crypto experience) then I
   know <em>instantly</em> that I can't trust you to follow good practice and
   maintain your secret information, and that I shouldn't trust you with my
   secrets.  So protect your revocation key like you protect your secret
   keys.  Read on to see why the "this key is my new key, ignore the others"
   excuse is an immediate "red flag" that should make you suspect either
   cryptographical incompetence or warn you that the person's being
   impersonated.
  </p>

  <h2>Using Stronger Algorithms</h2>
  <p>
   This section is optional but important.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   By default, gpg uses weaker encryption algorithms than it could.  This is
   to ensure compatibility with older versions.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want to start using stronger algorithms from the beginning, jump to
   the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a> section
   below to see how to use stronger algorithms by default.  It may be
   important to do this from the start, as the algorithms that you want to use
   are specified in your public key.  (To be more specific, your public key
   lists the algorithms that you request <em>other people</em> to use when they
   encrypt messages to you.)
  </p>

  <h2><a name="ProcedureForVerification">Procedure for Verification</a></h2>
  <p>
   Now, since you have my public key, are we secure?  Well, no, not at all.
   Lots of people just getting started with cryptography don't realize that
   they have to somehow <em>verify</em> that this key belongs to me.  To me,
   Alan Eliasen.  The one who wrote this message.   How do you know that the
   public key posted above is the one I posted?  After all, the bad guys could
   have replaced it somehow.
  </p>

  <p>
   Listen carefully.  This is important.  <em>Anyone</em> can generate a
   public key for <em>any</em> e-mail address.  <em>Anyone</em> can post that
   key to <em>any</em> key server.  <em>Only by verifying that the key really
   belongs to the person you think it does does it give you any security.</em>
   Without this crucial verification, all that your cryptographic software
   does is ensures that bits weren't corrupted during transmission, and
   prevents casual observers from reading the message.  It does <em>not</em>
   mean that you're talking to who you think you are.  You could be talking to
   someone else entirely (a bad guy,) or you could be subject to a
   man-in-the-middle attack.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Update:</b> As proof of the above paragraph, after I posted this
   document widely, on 2013-07-12, somebody generated a fake public key with
   my e-mail address and uploaded it to a key server!  <em>This is why you
   need to validate the key directly with the person to make sure you have the
   right key and the right person!</em> That is, however, an unavoidable
   problem with public key servers.  I thus can't be mad about it, but I
   <em>can</em> try to educate people to recognize this possibility and do the
   right thing by validating my public key with me personally!  Note that
   picking a key from multiple options on a keyserver based on which is newest
   or largest or by comments about "this is my newest key" <em>is dangerous
   and wrong.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Another Update:</b> Forgery of public keys on keyservers is now
   widespread.  On 2016-08-15, many people noted that someone had uploaded
   fake public keys and signatures for everyone in (an old copy of) the GPG
   "strong set".  These keys even matched the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ShortKeyID">short key
   ID</a> of the original key, <em>as well as forging all its signatures!</em>
   It appears that someone finally uploaded the proof-of-concept that the
   folks at <a href="https://evil32.com/">Evil 32</a> had posted years before.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Still, if you want to send me encrypted e-mail, that may prevent other
   people from reading it.  That's good, and sometimes that's all you need.
   Just understand why I don't have any reason to trust that you're who you
   say you are, and you don't have any reason to trust that you're really
   talking to <em>me</em> unless you've verified my key with me.  Before I
   trust you with any secrets, I'll validate your identity.
  </p>

  <p>
   On the other hand, you may not be able to verify someone's fingerprint in
   person.  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#WebOfTrust">Web of Trust</a> section for more
   about this.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Fingerprint">Fingerprint</a></h3>
  <p>
   A key could be verified in many ways (such as, I could read you my whole
   public key, which is really time-consuming and error-prone.  It's also bad
   because the key you see above can get longer and longer as other people
   sign it.)  The usual alternative is to compare the <em>fingerprint</em> of
   what <em>you</em> think my public key is with the fingerprint of what I
   <em>know</em> my public key is.
  </p>

  <p>
   A fingerprint is a shorter number (usually expressed as a
   40-hexadecimal-digit number) that contains a cryptographically strong hash
   of my public key.  It's shorter than my full key, so it's not an unfoolable
   test, but the probability of finding another key with this fingerprint is
   very small indeed.  Infinitesimally small.  So small you don't have to
   worry about it.  If someone else can find a matching fingerprint, they have
   enough power and money that they could make you vanish from the face of the
   earth.  So, after you've imported my key, type:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --fingerprint eliasen@mindspring.com</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This will produce output that looks something like below (I have put the
   fingerprint in bold.)
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>
pub   4096R/ED873D23 2014-07-22<br>
      Key fingerprint = <b>EC23 92F2 EDE7 4488 680D  A3CF 5F2B 4756 ED87 3D23</b><br>
uid                  Alan Eliasen &lt;eliasen@mindspring.com&gt;<br>
sub   4096R/5314E70B 2014-07-22<br>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Then, you need to verify this fingerprint with me.  It's best to do it
   face-to-face, but if it's someone you know by voice, you can do it on the
   phone.  If you don't know the person, check their driver's license.  Ask
   other people (that you trust) who know them.  Even if you don't know them,
   at least you're verifying that the key belongs to the person you're talking
   to.
  </p>

  <p>
   The other person will need to verify that their (unverified) copy of your
   public key matches what you know your public key to be.  So bring a copy of
   your own fingerprint to the exchange:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --fingerprint <i>your@email.address</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Of course, change the e-mail address above to the e-mail address you're
   confirming.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Corollary:</i> If someone puts the fingerprint of their key in their
   e-mail signature, or in a web page, they really aren't proving their
   identity.  Think about it.  If someone's pretending to be you, and
   forging your e-mail or your web site, they'd certainly replace the
   fingerprint too.  It's not enough to rely on.  If you see someone with
   their key fingerprint in their e-mail signature, it's not a reliable sign
   that the key with that fingerprint truly belongs to them.
  </p>

  <p>
   On the other hand, you may not be able to verify someone's fingerprint in
   person.  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#WebOfTrust">Web of Trust</a> section for more
   about this.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="FingerprintsInEnigmail">Fingerprints in Enigmail</a></h4>
  <p>
   If you want to view a person's fingerprint or key ID in Enigmail, you can
   view that in the "Key Management" dialog, which is the place where you can
   view and manage public and private keys for everyone in your keyring.
  </p>

  <p>
   The steps to view the fingerprint are to follow the menu items:
   <code>Enigmail</code> | <code>Key Management</code> | Search for a name |
   Right-click the name | <code>Key Properties</code>.  This will bring up a
   dialog containing lots of information about the key, including its key ID
   and fingerprint (unfortunately, it's not easily printable.)
  </p>
   
  <h3>My Key Verification Protocol</h3>
  <p>
   If you wish to verify this key, please contact me and I will verify its
   fingerprint in a public meeting-place.  I will be wearing a trenchcoat and
   a navy blue ascot.  You must wear or carry a yellow tulip.  Any other
   flower signifies that contact should be aborted, even if the exchange below
   is executed correctly.  I must not underestimate the necessity of having an
   adequate stock of proper yellow tulips on hand for this purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
   I will say "The adobe is filled with an excess of straw this season."
  </p>

  <p>You must reply "The straw is for the young lambs which roam the heaths
   near Glasgow in the green, green spring."
  </p>

  <p>If I am satisfied with your response, I will reply "The greens at Saint
   Andrew's are boiled with ham and contain an excess of bitter kale."
  </p>

  <p>
   Do not make eye contact or show signs of recognition.  If necessary, I will
   read the hexadecimal digits of the fingerprint while feigning a book order
   on my cell phone.
  </p>

  <p>
   Okay, I'm sort of kidding about this section.  But you
   <em>must verify keys with the other person to be truly secure.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you have verified my key, and trust me (and trust your own
   verification,) be sure to sign it.
  </p>


  <h2><a name="SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a></h2>
  <p>
   Now that you've verified my identity, and my public key, you need to tell
   your cryptographical software that you trust my key.  Otherwise, your
   cryptographical software should do the right thing and warn you that you're
   communicating with someone that you haven't verified.  It's telling you
   that it has no reason to believe that the key you're using is the one that
   actually belongs to that person.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below are tips for signing and trusting keys using both GPG and Enigmail.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SigningKeysInEnigmail">Signing Keys in Enigmail</a></h3>
  <p>
    I'm a bit reticent to recommend using Enigmail to sign keys because some
    of its dialogs are deceptive and wrong.  Read the next part very carefully.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In Enigmail, you can sign keys by going to the menu
    item <code>Enigmail | Key Management</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Search for the key, and then right-click it.  You'll get the option to
    sign the key.
  </p>

  <p>
   After signing the key, you should assign a trust level to the
   <em>person</em> signing the key.  Right-click the key name and choose "Set
   Owner Trust".  <b>Warning:</b> This currently pops up a dialog that asks
   "how much do you trust the key?" but that's <em>not the right
   question</em>!  The meaning of trust in the GPG software is <em>how much
   you trust the <b>person</b> to validate <b>other</b> people's keys</em>,
   not how much you trust the key itself!  In GPG, the question is stated as:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other
    users' keys (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different
    sources, etc.)"
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   As you can see, that's a totally different question.  This is why I
   encourage you to learn by using GPG on the command-line.  It tends to be
   more rigorous and correct.  Also GPG gives you more warnings about
   selecting dangerous choices like "trust ultimately."  Read the next section
   to find out more.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SigningKeysInGPG">Signing keys in GPG</a></h3>
  <p>
   To sign my key from gpg, you'll do something like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --sign-key eliasen@mindspring.com</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    (but see below for a better option.)
  </p>

  <p>
   This will give you some options for signing the key.  Even better would be
   to edit your signature <em>and</em> trust settings for this user using the
   interactive menu:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key eliasen@mindspring.com</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Hint:</i> Type <code>help</code> for the interactive commands.  The
   commands <code>sign</code> and <code>trust</code> are the ones you're
   looking for.  These allow you to both sign a key and indicate how much you
   trust me to verify <em>other</em> peoples' keys.  If you think I'm stupid
   and lax when verifying and signing other peoples' keys, you'd assign me a
   low trust rating.
  </p>

  <p>
   After you've signed someone's key, you should send it back to them so
   they can show other people that you've signed it.  You can export their key
   using:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --export --armor <i>their@email.address</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   and then sending that output to them.  They can then import the changes
   using
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --import</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In Enigmail, you can also attach any of the public keys in your keyring to
   an e-mail.  As you're composing the email, select <code>Enigmail | Attach
    Public Key...</code> and select the e-mail addresses to attach.  Note that
   these will not show up in the body of the message, but as a
   (possibly-encrypted) attachment, possibly using PGP/MIME.  For maximum
   portability, I recommend attaching using the <code>--export</code> method
   above and including the public key in the body of the message.  My reasons
   are stated in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Attachments">Attachments</a> section.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also upload that signature to a keyserver, which makes that
   signature available to the world.  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Publishing">Publishing
    your Public Key</a> section below for how to do this.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you're really not sure about my identity, and don't want to vouch for me
   publicly, you can <em>locally</em> sign my key, which means that you
   trust it for your own use only:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --lsign-key eliasen@mindspring.com</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Hint:</i> If you publicly sign my key without actually verifying it
   with me, I'm going to assign you a very low trust rating.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Publishing">Publishing your Public Key</a></h2>
  <p>
   Sure, you can manually send your public key to people you want to
   communicate with, but what if someone needs to communicate with you
   securely and you haven't sent them your public key?  The usual way is that
   you publish your public key to a keyserver so that anyone can import your
   key.  Most of the keyservers in the world mirror each
   other, so a short time after you have posted your key to one server, it will
   be propagated to the others.  As I have said above, I've had good luck for
   the past decade with <code>pgp.mit.edu</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   You have some responsibilities before publishing your public key (or
   someone else's) to a keyserver, though.  As mentioned above in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> and <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ProcedureForVerification">Procedure for Verification</a> sections,
   you better have generated a revocation certificate for your key and put it
   somewhere very safe.  Otherwise, if you lose your secret key, or it becomes
   compromised, the corresponding public key will sit <em>forever</em> on
   public keyservers, mocking you and demonstrating that you don't know how to
   protect your secrets properly.  If you think you can delete a key from a
   keyserver, rather than revoking it, read the <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/faq.html">FAQ at MIT's keyserver.</a> (I think
   it's funny and awesome that they have a fake "delete a key" field on their
   website that just redirects to that FAQ no matter what key you enter.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If someone has your public key, they can basically do a few things with it:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Encrypt messages that only you can decrypt.
    
   </li><li>Validate that messages were signed by your secret key with a strong
    guarantee of certainty, and ensure that those messages were not tampered
    with or corrupted in transmission.
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   These are good things.  You <em>want</em> people to have your public key.
   So below are a few methods of publishing your public key to a
   keyserver.  All achieve the same results.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ManualExporting">Manual Exporting and Uploading</a></h3>
  <p>
   Now that you have generated a secret key and a public key, how do people
   find your public key so that they can send encrypted mail to you?  You can
   send someone your public key directly by, say, putting it in an email.  To
   generate a copy of your public key that is easily e-mailed, you can do:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --armor --export <i>your@email.address</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This will generate a nicely-formatted "ASCII armored" version of your
   public key which is suitable for e-mailing.  "ASCII armor" is just a way of
   turning raw binary data (which will probably get corrupted if you try to
   send it through most e-mail programs) into a format using only limited
   ASCII characters, line-wrapped, with appropriate headers, and suitable for
   e-mailing.  (Hint:  It'll look something like my public key at the top of
   the page.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the lines that begin 
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code>-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</code>
  </p>

  and end with

  <p class="code">
   <code>-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <em>are</em> a necessary part of the message.  Don't forget to include
   them!
  </p>

  <p>
   Once you have this ASCII-armored public key, you can manually paste it into
   a form at a public key server like <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">pgp.mit.edu</a>
  </p>

  <p>
   Again, just because someone seems to have sent you their public key,
   there's no reason to trust that it's from that person unless you have
   validated it with them using the instructions in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ProcedureForVerification">Procedure for Verification</a> section
   above.  Make sure you verify any keys before trusting them!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="UploadingViaGPG">Uploading a Public Key via GPG</a></h3>
  <p>
   One way to publish your key to a keyserver is the manual approach from the
   previous section:  export an ASCII-armored key and manually paste it in to
   a form like the one at <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">pgp.mit.edu</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The other way is to let your <code>gpg</code> program upload the key.  You
   can't do this by specifying the e-mail address; you need to specify the
   public key's hexadecimal ID number.  So how do you find this for the key
   you want to upload?
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --list-keys <i>your@email.address</i></code><br><br>
   <code class="output">
pub   4096R/<b>ED873D23</b> 2014-07-22<br>
uid                  Alan Eliasen &lt;eliasen@mindspring.com&lt;<br>
sub   4096R/5314E70B 2014-07-22<br>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In the above, my public key id is displayed on a line that says
   <code>pub</code> and contains an 8-character hexadecimal code
   (<code>ED873D23</code> in the sample above.)  You will need to know this
   code to upload to the server.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --send-keys <i>keyID</i></code><br>
   <code class="output">gpg: sending key ED873D23 to hkp server subkeys.pgp.net</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You may want/need to insert <code>--keyserver pgp.mit.edu</code> as options
   to the above if you want a specific keyserver.  (These options have to go
   <em>before</em> commands like <code>--send-keys</code>.  Again, most
   keyservers mirror each other, but it will take time for keys to propagate
   across all servers.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that after you've signed <em>someone else's</em> public key,
   indicating that you've verified their key and identity and vouch that the
   key is theirs, you can use this same procedure to upload your signed
   version of their public key to a keyserver, so people can see you've
   vouched for them.  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#WebOfTrust">Web of Trust</a> section
   below for more information about this.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="UploadingViaEnigmail">Uploading a Public Key via Enigmail</a></h3>
  <p>
   Again, in Enigmail, everything you do with keys is accessed through the
   menu item <code>Enigmail | Key Management</code>.  Search for the key you
   want to upload, right-click it, and you have the option to upload it to a
   keyserver.  Couldn't be easier!  You still have the same responsibilities
   to be very careful with signing other people's keys, though.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="ManuallyDecrypting">Manually Decrypting</a></h2>
  <p>
   So you've received a file or message encrypted with GPG, but you don't have
   a fancy e-mail plugin to help you decode it.  So how do you decode
   manually?  Simple.  From the command-line, if you just run <code>gpg</code>
   it will prompt you for input:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg</code><br>
   <code class="output">gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   From there, you can just cut-and-paste your message directly into gpg, and
   it will decrypt it, or import keys, or whatever is appropriate to the
   message.  When you're done pasting, you may need to send your operating
   system's "end-of-file" character.  This is <code>Ctrl-D</code> in most
   Unixlike systems and <code>Ctrl-Z</code> in Windows-like systems.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the encrypted data is in a file, you can automatically process it by
   just passing the filename to gpg on the command-line.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg <i>myfilename</i></code><br>
  </p>

  <p>
   The gpg executable will generally just do the right thing with it,
   prompting you for passwords when necessary, saving output files, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b><a name="Shred">Warning:</a></b> When gpg encrypts or decrypts a file,
   it usually <em>leaves the original file intact!</em>.  You must remember to
   delete the original file yourself, securely if possible.  In Linux, you can
   use <code>shred -u</code> (shred just overwrites by default; the
   <code>-u</code> is necessary to delete the file afterward) or
   <code>wipe</code> commands to delete securely.  On
   Windows, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete">sdelete</a>
   works well.  (Although secure deleting isn't guaranteed to work on solid
   state drives or flash drives due to wear-leveling algorithms.  If you're
   using one of these, and want to securely delete, you have to write
   over <em>all your free space</em> with a tool like <code>wipe</code>
   or <code>sdelete</code>) However, don't believe the hype that you need to
   do dozens of overwrite
   steps.  <a href="https://www.nber.org/sys-admin/overwritten-data-gutmann.html">This 
   is very likely urban legend, or marketing lies.</a>  One overwrite is
   probably plenty.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="DecryptingFiles">Decrypting Files</a></h3>
  <p>
   While gpg's default action is usually sensible, when you run gpg to decrypt
   a file without any command-line options like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You should be warned that the default action (when passed the name of an
   encrypted file) is to decrypt the file <em>and leave the encrypted and the
   decrypted file on your disc!</em> This may be dangerous as it theoretically
   allows an attacker to mount a "known plaintext" attack.  You almost never
   want to have encrypted and decrypted versions of the same file on your
   system.  You must remember to delete one of the files yourself, securely if
   possible. See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Shred">warning above</a> for more details on
   how to do this.
  </p>

  <p>
   However, if you just want to <em>view</em> the contents of an encrypted
   file, and leave it encrypted, without saving the decrypted version
   anywhere, use the <code>-d</code> or <code>--decrypt</code> option (which
   are equivalent.)  This option just decrypts the contents of the file and
   displays the file contents to standard output, without saving a file.  Your
   command would look like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg -d <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This never saves a decrypted file anywhere, and lets you easily look at the
   contents of encrypted files.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="ManuallyEncrypting">Manually Encrypting</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="EncryptingForEmail">Encrypting for E-mail</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you don't have a fancy e-mail plugin that helps you encrypt your
   messages, it's easy enough to do from the command line.  You'll need to
   save your message to a file.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r <i>recipient@email</i> -r
    <i>your@email.com</i> <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   There are several important things in this command.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li><code>--encrypt</code> tells gpg to encrypt the message using
    public-key encryption.

   </li><li><code>--sign</code> adds a digital signature that lets you guarantee
    that the message was generated by you and was not corrupted nor modified in
    transmission.  This is theoretically optional, but see the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningMessages">Signing Messages</a> section below for why this
    is very important.

   </li><li><code>--armor</code> wraps your output in plaintext "ASCII
    armor". "ASCII armor" is just a way of turning raw binary data (which will
    probably get corrupted if you try to send it through most e-mail programs)
    into a format using only limited ASCII characters, line-wrapped, with
    appropriate headers, and suitable for e-mailing.  This is necessary if
    you're pasting this into the body of an e-mail, or usenet posting, or forum
    posting, etc.

   </li><li><code>-r <i>recipient</i></code> Specifies recipients of the message.
    You must already have imported the public keys of the recipients.  You can
    specify multiple recipients.  If you don't specify recipients on the
    command-line, gpg will prompt you to enter them interactively.  These
    recipients can also be key IDs.
    
    <p>
     <b>Warning!  This is important and interesting!</b> Note that in the
     example above, <em>your</em> email address is specified as one of the
     recipients.  If you do not explicitly add <em>your own</em> address to
     the list of recipients, <em>you will not be able to decrypt the
     message!</em> That is interesting and important and awesome.  You may
     want to write something and send it to someone <em>that you cannot ever
     possibly be compelled to decrypt!</em> It will be impossible for you to
     decrypt, even though you wrote it and encrypted it!  That is cool. 
     Read the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Cool">Why Public-Key Encryption is Cool</a> section
     below for more about why public-key encryption is cool.
    </p>

   </li><li><code><i>filename</i></code> is the filename of the file you're
    encrypting.  This is not strictly required.  If you don't specify a
    filename, GPG will listen for input, and you can type a message directly or
    cut and paste it in.  This is awkward, though.  When you're done pasting,
    you may need to send your operating system's "end-of-file" character.  This

  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="EncryptingFiles">Encrypting Files</a></h3>
  <p>
   GPG is not just for e-mail!  You may want to use it to protect your
   sensitive files also.  Encrypting your files is just about like encrypting
   an e-mail.  The simplest command line is:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --encrypt <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This will prompt you for the recipients (which should include your own
   e-mail address so you can decrypt it!)
  </p>

  <p>
   A more complete command-line might look like:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --encrypt --sign -r <i>your@email.com</i> <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Some interesting things to note and optional arguments:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li><code>--encrypt</code> tells gpg to encrypt the message using
    public-key encryption.  (See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Symmetric">Symmetric
     Encryption/Decryption</a> section below for alternate ways to encrypt a
    file with a simple password and no public keys.)

   </li><li><code>--sign</code> adds a digital signature that lets you guarantee
    that the message was generated by you and was not corrupted nor modified in
    transmission.  This is theoretically optional, but very important.
    <p>
     Think about it: how do you know that someone didn't replace your
     encrypted file with a different one?  By digitally signing the
     message, you can get a strong guarantee that you're the one who encrypted
     the message and that it hasn't been tampered with or corrupted.  See <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningMessages">Signing Messages</a> section below for more on
     digital signatures.
    </p>

   </li><li><code>--armor</code> (optional, probably unnecessary) wraps your output

    e-mailing.  This is necessary if you're pasting this into the body of an
    e-mail, or usenet posting, or forum posting, etc.  Note that this will
     increase the size of your message on disk.

   </li><li><code>--output <i>filename</i></code> (optional) specify the output file.

   </li><li><code>-r <i>recipient</i></code> Specifies recipients of the message.
    Can also be written <code>--recipient</code>.  You must already have
    imported the public keys of the recipients.  You can specify multiple
    recipients with multiple <code>-r</code> arguments.  If you don't specify
    recipients on the command-line, gpg will prompt you to enter them
    interactively.  These recipients can also be key IDs.
    
    <p>
     <b>Warning!  This is important and interesting!</b> Note that in the
     example above, <em>your</em> email address is specified as one of the

  </li></ul>

  
  <h2><a name="Attachments">Attachments and PGP/MIME</a></h2>
  <p>
   What do you do if you want to send an encrypted file attachment in an
   e-mail?
  </p>

  <p>
   There is a standard called PGP/MIME that try to standardize the handling of
   encrypted attchments.  You cannot be sure that your recipient's e-mail
   client will be able to handle them, so I strongly recommend <em>never using
   them</em>.  Enigmail doesn't even handle its <em>own</em> attachments that
   it creates well.
  </p>

  <p>
   Examples of situations that will cause PGP/MIME or S/MIME attachments to
   fail or be lost:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Most web-based email services.
   </li><li>Most phone- and tablet-based email software.
   </li><li>List servers or remailers that strip attachments.
   </li><li>List servers that just don't handle all attachments perfectly.
   </li><li>Corporate firewalls that remove attachments.
   </li><li>Overeager malware scanners.
   </li><li>Simple, secure e-mail clients that can only display plaintext.
   </li><li>Not-yet-ready-for-attachments e-mail tools like Enigmail itself.
   </li><li>Mail servers that create non-standards-compliant attachments like
    Microsoft Exchange.  (Enigmail warns you about broken attachments from
    Exchange and gives you a button to try and fix them.  It works for
    some simple messages with single attachments, and destroys others.)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   I strongly recommend <em>always</em> sending encrypted messages or
   encrypted attachments as ASCII-armored OpenPGP blocks directly in the body
   of an e-mail.  This will ensure that any e-mail program will still be able
   to handle them.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can hand-encrypt any attachments using:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --armor --encrypt --sign -r <i>your@email.com</i>
    -r <i>recipient@email.com</i> <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   as outlined in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#EncryptingFiles">Encrypting Files</a> section
   above.  Then just paste the results into the body of your e-mail.  You can
   paste in multiple attachments this way, too.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="AttachmentsInEnigmail">Attachments in Enigmail</a></h3>
  <p>
   Enigmail is buggy and insecure when sending and receiving encrypted
   attachments or PGP/MIME.  <em>I don't recommend it at the moment.  In fact,
   the bugs are so severe that Enigmail's behavior may allow others to obtain
    your entire secret key.</em>  
  </p>

  <p>
   Enigmail fails, for instance, to import a public key or other attachments
   that it attached itself.  You can test this by sending encrypted
   attachments and public keys to yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
   Enigmail is also insecure in handling PGP/MIME (and possibly S/MIME)
   attachments because it appears to always automatically and silently decrypt
   the message for you, <em>even if you have Enigmail configured to not
   decrypt by default!</em> This is very bad if someone's looking over your
   shoulder, or detecting emanations from your monitor (e.g TEMPEST) or doing
   <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/">sound-based attacks</a>.
   You may not even notice that the message was encrypted, and forget to
   encrypt your reply, or forget to verify the signature, or do something that
   compromises your security. It turns out that this is a known bug <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/bugs/226/">Enigmail Bug #226</a>
   which the developers have inexplicably labeled as "Minor."  Augh.  They are
   obviously oblivious to the literature.  In fact, the <em>creators</em> of
   the RSA algorithm have explicitly stated in one of the most
   widely-circulated papers on GPG that this particular bug in Enigmail is
   what lets them completely steal your private key, using nothing but a
   microphone near your computer or an electrical connection (e.g. touching
   your skin or monitoring your computer's electricity usage) while you
   receive an e-mail!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even if you fix the problem above, Enigmail is <em>still</em> buggy when
    handling PGP/MIME messages, as it will try to auto-save your messages as
    you write them, which can pop up a dialog asking you to choose recipients
    to encrypt to while you're typing, causing you to randomly select
    recipients as you type.  It's just totally broken and annoying.
  </p>

  <p>
   For these reasons, I recommend using the manual procedure above, but here
   are some tips for using Enigmail if you're lazy and don't care if your
   attachments get lost or are unreadable by your recipient.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="DisablingPGPMIME">Disabling PGP/MIME in Enigmail</a></h4>
  <p>
   The place to turn off PGP/MIME in Thunderbird/Enigmail has been continually
   changing, but now it's currently hidden under each e-mail account on the
   (usually) left-hand side of your screen under <code>OpenPGP Security</code>
   where the option <code>Use PGP/MIME by default</code> should be unchecked.
   Here's the <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/documentation/per-account.php">current
   screenshot from the Enigmail project</a> showing where PGP/MIME should be
   turned off for each account.
  </p>

  <p>
   When sending encrypted e-mails with attachments in Enigmail, you will be
   presented with a dialog asking how you want files to be attached:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <img src="./GPG tutorial_files/smime.png" width="559" height="303" alt="Enigmail file
    attachment prompt.  Choose the option for using inline PGP.">
  </p>

  <p>
   Choose the option "Encrypt/sign each attachment separately and send the
   message using inline PGP."  However, this doesn't even do the right thing.
   Its results are unfortunately <em>not</em> identical to the recommended
   "hand-encrypt and paste" technique described above.  It currently still
   adds multiple attachments, which may get stripped out by mail filters or
   lost in web-based e-mail clients.  Enigmail is then often unable to open
   these attachments reliably.  It certainly can't open public keys that it
   attaches.  Really, just don't use Enigmail for attachments right now.
   Hand-encrypt them as shown in the previous section.  It'll simply work
   better for more people.
  </p>

  <p>
   In short, all encrypted communications will be accessible to the most
   people if you always just use ASCII-armored OpenPGP blocks in the body of a
   plaintext message.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="SigningMessages">Signing Messages</a></h2>
  <p>
    In addition to encryption, gpg allows you to digitally "sign" messages,
    which has multiple benefits:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It lets you ensure that a message has not been corrupted nor modified
      in transmission.

    </li><li>It allows someone to verify that <em>you</em> signed it.  (To be more
     precise, to verify that the signer of the message used your secret key,
     given that they've verified your public key with you, and that your secret
     key hasn't been compromised.)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
    You should always sign your encrypted messages.  Think about it.
    <em>Everyone</em> potentially has your public key.  That's expected.
    <em>Anyone</em> can encrypt a message to you using your public key, and
    pretend that it's from someone you know.  (It's easy to spoof e-mails, but
    that's another discussion.)  <em>Only if you verify (via the digital
    signature) that the message was signed by someone whose key you have
    verified, can you trust the communication.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Corollary:</i>  You should actively distrust unsigned encrypted
    communications.  If someone's trying to impersonate your friends, they'll
    just conveniently "forget" to sign their messages.
  </p>

  <p>
    A signed message gives a mathematically <em>very</em> strong certainty
    that the message was signed by you.
  </p>

  <p>
    In your e-mail client, always choose to sign <em>and</em> encrypt a
    message.  Below are some ways to sign messages manually.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="EnigmailAutomaticSigning">Configuring Enigmail for Automatic Signing</a></h3>
  <p>
   By default, Enigmail does <em>not</em> automatically sign encrypted
   e-mails.  This is a bad choice, in my opinion (stated in the section above.)
  </p>

  <p>
   You can, however, make Enigmail automatically sign all encrypted mails.
   The setting is <em>very</em> hard to find, though.  You need to do the
   following:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    The first thing you want to do in Enigmail is to make all of its settings
    visible.  If you haven't done so already, you can do this from the menu
    items <code>Enigmail | Preferences | Display Expert Settings</code>.  The
    basic settings are inadequate.
    
   </li><li>Start to compose a new e-mail.  That is, click the "Write" button.

   </li><li>In the "Write" window, choose the <em>top</em>  menubar item
    <code>Enigmail | Default Composition Options | Signing/Encryption
     Options</code>.

   </li><li>Check the <code>Sign encrypted messages by default</code> box.

   </li><li>Click OK.
  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="SigningPlaintext">Signing a Plaintext Message</a></h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes you just want to sign an unencrypted message to make it clear
    that you produced it and that it hasn't been tampered with nor corrupted in
    transmission.  For example:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Sending an important vote.
    
   </li><li>Important business communications.
    
   </li><li>Maybe you're mailing a URL that looks suspicious and spammy, and your
    recipient wants to validate that it's actually from you and not from a
    spammer or a virus.  (Saying "this is really from me" in the e-mail is
    not good enough!)
    
   </li><li>Being very certain that the message is not corrupted in transmission.
    
   </li><li>Allowing recipients to verify that data comes from you and is valid.
    For example, a school could prove that test scores came from them and
    were not tampered with.  (Institutions should use this more!)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
    The <code>--clearsign</code> option will wrap the message in an
    ASCII-armored signature but will not otherwise modify its contents.  This
    allows even the losers who don't use gpg to read the body of the message,
    but allows gpg users to verify that you wrote it and that the message
    wasn't changed.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --clearsign <i>filename</i></code><br><br>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="VerifyingSignatures">Verifying Signatures</a></h3>
  <p>
   People who have verified your public key can verify messages that you've
   signed by passing the output back into gpg:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
    <code class="input">gpg --verify vote.txt.asc</code><br><br>
   <code class="output">
    gpg: Signature made Sat 02 Aug 2014 04:45:50 AM MDT using RSA key ID ED873D23<br>
gpg: Good signature from "Alan Eliasen &lt;eliasen@mindspring.com&gt;"
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If they haven't verified and signed your public key, then they will be
   warned that the key is untrusted.  This means that all that they can tell
   for certain is that the message wasn't corrupted in transmission, <em>but it
    really could have been written by anyone!</em>  Beware "Untrusted good
   signature!"  It means that the signature is by someone whose fingerprint
   you haven't verified.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="DetachedSignature">Detached Signature</a></h3>
  <p>
   Sometimes you want to sign a file, but without modifying it like the
   <code>--clearsign</code> option above does, because people would need to
   edit the file or use gpg to get at the contents.
  </p>

  <p>
   Say, you're sending an executable file to someone.  You don't want to
   tamper with the executable file, but executable files are scary and
   potentially very dangerous.  So how can you guarantee to the recipient
   that nobody has tampered with the file and that it actually came from you?
   By creating a "detached signature" which is a separate file that contains
   a signature for the specified file.  This is achieved through the
   <code>--detach-sign</code> command:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
    <code class="input">gpg --detach-sign <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Then you ship the signature file along with the original file.  The
    recipient can verify that you signed the file and that it has not been
    modified with the <code>--verify</code> command:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
    <code class="input">gpg --verify <i>filename.sig</i></code><br><br>
   <code class="output">
    gpg: Signature made Sat 02 Aug 2014 04:45:50 AM MDT using RSA key ID ED873D23<br>
    gpg: Good signature from "Alan Eliasen &lt;eliasen@mindspring.com&gt;"
   </code>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ProvingAnonymous">Proving You Wrote Something but Remaining Temporarily Anonymous</a></h3>
  <p>
    Let's say you found out that a huge company (we'll call them Mapple) wrote
    a really crappy incompetent insecure website that leaked a lot of their
    customers' information that anyone could access trivially by adding 1 to a
    number.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, you're not sure if the company is awesome and honest and will pay you
    a handsome bug bounty for pointing out their incompetent security hole and
    helping them protect their customers' information, or if they are
    psychotic morons who will claim <i>post-facto</i> that your access of
    information they intentionally published on a public webserver without any
    access control was "unauthorized" and have you charged under the insanely
    incompetently-written and outdated Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa">CFAA</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    So, how do you report this anonymously?  Well, one very strong way would be
    to generate a new keypair without your name on it, publish that public key,
    and sign all your messages with the corresponding secret key.  This lets
    you do a few things:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>You can prove that all subsequent messages signed with the same key
    are from the same person, even if you jump to different e-mail addresses
    or communication channels.

   </li><li>If they decide to be honest and offer you a bounty for your services
    to them and their customers, you can prove in the future that you're the
    person in possession of the corresponding secret key that signed the
    messages, for example, by decrypting something sent to you encrypted with
    your public key.  Nobody else would be able to falsely claim that they're
    the submitter without verifying that they have the corresponding secret
    key.

   </li><li>If they are evil about it, you can remain anonymous to them.  If
    you want to prove to others that you made the disclosure, you can, by
    signing a message with the same secret key or decrypting information sent
    to you that was encrypted with your public key (by using your secret key.)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   (This is a mathematically super-strong version of the old trick of ripping
   a dollar bill in half, and sending half of it to someone.  If they want to
   verify your identity, only you will have the other half of the bill.  A
   dollar bill, with distinctive tearing pattern and matching serial numbers,
   is hard to forge.)
  </p>

  <h2><a name="UpdatingKeys">Updating Keys</a></h2>
  <p>
    People are constantly updating their keys for various reasons:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Keys get compromised or lost and they are revoked.
   </li><li>Keys are signed by more people, building a <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#WebOfTrust">Web of
     Trust</a>.
   </li><li>Users change the encryption algorithms they prefer.  (See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a> section for more
    about this.)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
    Updates to keys can be published to public key servers, including new
    signatures.  You can periodically update your keys by using 
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --refresh-keys</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This lets you ensure that the keys you're using haven't been revoked.  You
   might even find that more people have signed your public key.  (And they
   better have validated your key fingerprint and your identity using the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ProcedureForVerification">verification procedure</a> outlined above,
   or they can't be trusted to sign keys properly and you should assign them a
   low trust rating!)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that other people can sign <em>your</em> public key and upload the
   signed key to a public webserver!  So you might even find that your own key
   has been updated!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="UpdatingKeysEnigmail">Updating Keys in Enigmail</a></h3>
  <p>
   Enigmail can update all of the keys in your keyring from a public key
   server.  The way to trigger this is from the menu items:
   <code>Enigmail</code> | <code>Key Management</code> | <code>Keyserver</code>
   | <code>Refresh all Public Keys</code>.  Again, I might suggest that
   <code>pgp.mit.edu</code> has been a reliable keyserver for me.

  </p><h3><a name="ListingKeys">Listing Your Keys</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can get a list of the keys on your keyring and their corresponding key
   IDs with:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --list-keys</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you enter part of the name or e-mail address or key ID as the last
   argument on the command-line, then only keys that match that pattern will
   be listed.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --list-keys Alan</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="WhoSigned">Who Signed My Key?</a></h3>
  <p>
   Now that you've updated keys from a keyserver, you might want to see who
   has signed your key.  After all, <em>anyone</em> can sign <em>any</em> key
   and re-upload that key to a key server.  You can see the signatures with
   the <code>--list-sigs</code> command to gpg:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --list-sigs <i>your@email.address</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In Enigmail, you can see the signatures for a key by going to <code>Enigmail
    | Key Management</code>, searching for a key, right-clicking on that key,
   and then choosing <code>View Signatures</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Or you can browse your key on a public keyserver, like <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">pgp.mit.edu</a>.  This is advantageous because
   if you haven't imported someone's key yet, they will just show up as a key
   ID number.  
  </p>

  <p>
   Again, if someone signed your key without validating the fingerprint with
   you, they are actively damaging the web of trust.  You should import their
   public key just so you can tell your software to actively distrust it as
   outlined in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section.
  </p>

  <p>
   (After I published this document, an out-of-control signer whom I've never
   met signed my key and published the changes to a public website.  I had to
   download his public key so I could tell gpg to actively distrust his
   signatures!)
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="WebOfTrust">Building a Web of Trust</a></h2>
  <p>
    In the examples above, I stress the importance of <em>verifying</em>
    people's public keys with them.  But sometimes you can't do that
    directly.  So how can you verify someone else's public key?
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's say I want to talk to Bob.  I've downloaded a public key with his
    name from a keyserver, but I can't be sure that key belongs to him.  I
    could maybe call him on the phone and verify his key that way, but I don't
    know his voice, and I don't have his phone number.  Or maybe he's even
    under duress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Luckily, my friend Alice has signed his public key.  I trust Alice to have
    verified his key properly.  I have validated and trusted Alice's public
    key personally.  Thus I have a good reason to believe that Bob's key
    really belongs to him.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is why it's important to validate other people's keys very carefully
    and to build a web of trust--so you can communicate with people whose keys
    you can't personally verify.
  </p>

  <p>
    See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section above to see how
    to sign someone else's key and upload it to a keyserver.
  </p>

  <p>
   Conversely, you may <em>not</em> want to publicly sign the keys of people
   you communicate with.  You may not want others to know who you communicate
   with.  You may have more than one keypair, and use them selectively for
   communications with a single person once they've demonstrated strong
   cryptographic practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is serious
    business.  <a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/the_spy_who_came_in_from_the_c.php?page=all">An
      example from Syria</a> shows how people die when others don't protect
    their communications.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don't want anyone to be able to analyze who you're talking to, even
    by traffic analysis of key IDs, you can
    specify <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#HiddenRecipients">hidden recipients</a> in your
    messages.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="GoodPractices">Good Encryption Practices</a></h2>
  <p>
    By using encryption improperly, you can make your encrypted communications
    easier to break.  Some of the tips here are speculative and may not apply
    to all cryptographic algorithms, but many cryptographic algorithms are
    subject to common types of attacks.  These tips will help mitigate those
    potential weaknesses if algorithms are found to be vulnerable to these
    types of attacks.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>TODO:  Improve ALL THE THINGS.</i>  <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">Send me more examples of good and bad
   cryptographic practice, and ciphers that have been broken by poor
    cryptographic practice.</a>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Don't be predictable.</b>  This is the way that much crypto has
      historically been broken--by knowing words or phrases that are likely to
      occur in the message.  This is known as
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack">"known-plaintext"</a>
      attack.  For example, the WWII German Enigma machine codes were
      partially broken because people would end with expected phrases like
    <span lang="de">"Heil Hitler!"</span> or from spelling out numbers.
    (Looking for the number
    <span lang="de">"eins"</span>, (1), the most common number, was a useful
    tactic in breaking Enigma.)

    <p>
     You think this is academic and known-plaintext attacks can't happen?
     Well, take a look at <a href="http://sac2013.irmacs.sfu.ca/slides/s9.pdf" target="_blank">this
      recent break on the widely-used RC4 cipher</a>.  (It's used in SSL/TLS
     and in WEP/WPA in wi-fi.)  It was found that if you knew a small amount
     of plaintext, you could recover the rest of the message (given a fairly
     large amount of encrypted communications, to be sure.)  With as little as
     6 bytes of plaintext, and a large number of communications, the rest of
     the message could be decrypted with high probability.  (The more bytes
     are known, the easier it is to break.) Also, keep in mind that breaks in
     cryptographic algorithms only break them further.
      
    </p></li><li><b>Don't be polite.</b> As a corollary of the above, don't start and
    end your message with predictable phrases or pleasantries.

    </li><li><b>Don't send HTML-formatted encrypted emails.</b> There's a large
    amount of predictable boilerplate in HTML.
      
    </li><li><b>No signatures!</b> As a corollary of the above, when sending
    encrypted messages, don't include your usual .sig file with your name,
    e-mail address, phone number, password, website, company policy, etc.

    <p>This doesn't mean "no cryptographic signatures!"  You still want
     cryptographically strong signatures like the kind you get with
     <code>--sign</code>.  Smart e-mail add-ons like Thunderbird with Enigmail
     can suppress your signature when using encryption.  Or you should encrypt
     just the meat of your email (and not the signature) if you <em>need</em>
     that silly signature.
      
    </p></li><li><b>Don't quote previously-encrypted text.</b>  When replying to an
      encrypted message, <em>don't quote the original text.</em>  Again,
      having large stretches of expected text has been the downfall of many
      cryptographic algorithms.
      
    </li><li><b>Don't encrypt the same message multiple times.</b>  Some codes have
      weaknesses that if the same plaintext message is encoded several times
      (say, to several different people, or to the same person multiple
      times,) then more information can be derived about the contents or the
      key.  If someone isn't able to read your encrypted message, don't send
      it again.  After all, they're not following good cryptographic practice
      if they can't read it, and you should limit encrypted communications
      with them.  Or, if you must send it again, alter it as much as possible
      before encrypting and sending it again.  If encrypting the same message
      to multiple people, encrypt to all of them at once (assuming you want
      them to know who you're communicating with.  They will at least see the
      key ID numbers.)
      
    </li><li><b>Don't have encrypted and unencrypted versions of the same
        information.</b>  As <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Shred">noted above</a>, gpg
        does <em>not</em> automatically delete the plaintext version of a file
        when you encrypt it!  Read that section on securely deleting files if
        possible.
      
    </li><li><b>Garbage is good.</b>  One of the hard problems in cryptography is
      identifying when a message has been successfully decrypted.  How do you
      know?  When it all comes out as mostly alphanumeric characters?  When
      its word frequency looks like English?  Make it hard for the bad guys.
      Jam in a bunch of random bytes into your message if you can.  It'll make
      it harder to even detect the fact that the message was decrypted
      properly.  Send your friends encrypted random bytes every day just for
      fun because screw the surveillance state we live in!  If everyone did
      this, it would be utterly prohibitive to try and decrypt all of the
      random data flying around.

    </li><li><b>If it's received encrypted, store it encrypted.</b> Some e-mailer
     plugins will offer to decrypt messages and store the decrypted versions in
     your mail folder.  Don't do this.  It allows someone to mount a
     chosen-plaintext attack on you just by sending you an encrypted message.
     Yes, it will make your messages impossible to search for content.  But
     that's good.
      
    </li><li><b>Don't encrypt stuff from untrusted sources.</b>  There is a class
      of attacks called
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack">"chosen-plaintext"</a>
      attack.  Some encryption algorithms can be weakened or completely
      defeated if the attacker is allowed to choose the text that you are
      going to encrypt with your key.  Always refuse to encrypt something
      specific that a third party asks you to encrypt, especially if it's
      lengthy.
      
    </li><li><b>Hide your encryption entirely!</b> There's a branch of cryptography
     called "steganography" which hides secret communications in innocuous
     places that are very hard to detect.  For example, by slightly modifying
     the least-significant-bits in the pixels of a JPEG image, you can hide
     encrypted messages in pictures of kittens!  Or, you can hide them by
     adding slight, undetectable noise to audio files.

      <p>It becomes <em>very</em> difficult and expensive to determine that a
        particular image even contains steganographic content.  That's the
        best way to hide your information, especially as the NSA has decided
        that using cryptography to protect your privacy is probable cause that
        you're a terrorist, and they allow themselves to keep encrypted
        content "for as long as necessary" to break it.

      </p><p>I have built some web-based <a href="https://futureboy.us/stegano/">Steganographic
          Tools</a> that let you experiment with steganography from your
          browser!  If you want to be more secure, of course, you'll run the
        steganography tools on your own machine.  That page tells you more
     about the <code>steghide</code> program.
     (Hint: in Fedora it's <code>dnf&nbsp;install&nbsp;steghide</code> )
  </p></li></ul>
  
  <h2><a name="Symmetric">Symmetric Encryption/Decryption</a></h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes you don't want to use public key encryption.  You can use
    old-fashioned "symmetrical" encryption where everyone shares a common
    password.  In gpg, you do this by using <code>--symmetric</code> instead
    of <code>--encrypt</code>:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --symmetric <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
    gpg will then prompt you for a password.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Warning:</b> (I'm repeating this again.)  When gpg encrypts or decrypts
    a file, it usually <em>leaves the original file intact!</em>.  You must
    remember to delete the original file yourself, securely if possible. See
    the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Shred">warning above</a> for more details on how to do this.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to paste the encrypted file into an e-mail or something, you
    can use the <code>--armor</code> option.
  </p>

  <p>
   The encrypted file can be decrypted by passing it back into gpg:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg <i>filename.gpg</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want to force the encryption algorithm used (the default is maybe
   CAST5), you can add the <code>--cipher-algo <i>name</i></code> command-line
   option, for example <code>--cipher-algo AES256</code> .  The list of
   available encryption algorithms in your version of gpg can be found by
   running the <code>gpg --version</code> command.
  </p>

  <p>
   Symmetric encryption has its problems.  It doesn't let you simultaneously
   sign the message to indicate that it hasn't been tampered with or replaced
   with another file that someone else generated!  (You can, however, sign it
   manually later using the techniques in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningMessages">Signing Messages</a> section, but it's
   theoretically possible that an attacker can replace that file in the brief
   time between when you encrypted it and when you signed it.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If you use symmetric encryption, you also need to solve the age-old
   problem "how do I communicate the password securely?"  Read on for the
   solution to that problem.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Cool">Why Public-Key Encryption is Cool</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In short, public-key encryption solves the age-old problem "how do I
      communicate a password securely?"  You no longer have to.  You just
      need the other person's public key, which can be published to the world.

    </li><li>You can also encrypt a message <em>that you can not decrypt!</em> This
    may sound silly, but you may want to write something to someone <em>that
    you cannot ever possibly be compelled to decrypt!</em> It will be
    impossible for you to decrypt, even though you wrote it and encrypted it
    and even if you have the file in your possession and even if you have all
    your secret keys and you know all of your own passwords and have them
    written down!  That is cool.  (You can smile serenely while they're
    beating you with a rubber hose, knowing that you can't endanger the lives
    of your sources, nor give up your rights, even if you felt like that might
    be entertaining for a change.)  You can see how to do this physically in
    the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#OneWayEncryption">Encrypting Messages You Can't Decrypt</a>
    section.

    <p>
     This actually has many important and practical uses:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>If you're a reporter (or other human) traveling abroad, you can
      encrypt materials using public-key encryption, to someone else's key, but
      <em>without</em> encrypting to your <em>own</em> public key.
      (<b>Warning</b>: some tools will encrypt to yourself by default.  Read
      on.)  It's easy to create a message that you can <em>never possibly</em>
      decrypt yourself, and cannot possibly be compelled to do so!  Ever!  You
      could encrypt them, say, using only the public key belonging to your
      newspaper's editor or lawyer.  (And if your newspaper's editor and lawyer
      don't have public keys, have them <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">contact me</a> and I will help
      them.  They need to do this.  Now.  Before they kill people.)  You can
      be detained and couldn't ever be compelled to give up the password, as
      <em>you never had it!</em>

      <p>
       You don't have to be in <a href="http://www.cjr.org/feature/the_spy_who_came_in_from_the_c.php?page=all">Syria</a>
       (although journalists who don't use encryption kill people; read the
       link) or North Korea for this type of Orwellian police state coercion
       to happen.  Even the otherwise-civilized United Kingdom has vile
       horrendous laws <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23776243">that
       can jail you without trial if you don't give up passwords.</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Edward Snowden has also stated that he has in his possession encrypted
       documents that he cannot possibly be compelled to decrypt, even under
       torture.  (But maybe other trusted people potentially can decrypt
       them.)  Public-key encryption is probably what he was hinting at.  Nice
       work.
      </p>

      <p>
       Also
       see the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#HiddenRecipients">Hidden Recipients</a> section of
       this document to see how to hide the people to whom you've encrypted.
       That may be <em>very</em> important for journalists or dissidents or
       ordinary people who want to assert their rights to free association.
       It also allows you to post encrypted messages to public forums without
       anyone knowing who you're talking to.
      </p>

      <p>
       Also see my <a href="https://futureboy.us/stegano/">Steganography tools</a> which let
       you hide the fact that any hidden communications are happening at all!
       You can hide secret communications in pictures of kitties.
      </p>

    </li><li>Let's say you have a web server that collects very sensitive user
    information.  You don't trust the security of the web server, but you have
    to keep the information on that web server for a while before you move it
    elsewhere.  Say, to a computer completely disconnected from the outside
    world.  With public key encryption, you can encrypt information with a
    public key stored on the web server.  However, the secret key would not
    ever be kept on that server!  Even if someone breaks your web server wide
    open and has total access to <em>every single file</em>, <em>and</em>
    every single algorithm, <em>and</em> the public key, they will still
    <em>never, ever</em> be able to decrypt the private information on the
    server <em>because the secret key needed to decrypt it is not on the
    server at all!</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_2wK4LWvJA">Miracles!</a>

    </li><li>If you rent space in a server farm, this can prevent malicious
     administrators at the hosting company (who probably hold superuser access
     on your machine, and can read all your files) from being able to do
     anything with your data.  And it keeps your web server administrator or
     database administrator from seeing that sensitive data, <em>even if they
      have complete access to every file on the computer.</em>

    </li><li>A real-world example of storing sensitive communications: The Federal
     Communication Commission's (FCC's) <a href="http://shns.com/privacy-on-the-line">Lifeline</a> subsidized
     cell-phone program for low-income people leaked highly sensitive customer
     information for over 170,000 people, including Social Security numbers,
     birth dates, home addresses, and sensitive details about family finances
     from a public web server.  Think about how you could use public-key
     encryption to collect and encrypt this data securely on the webserver,
     and only be able to decrypt it somewhere else much safer.
   </li></ul>

    <p>
     Again, see how to do this in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#OneWayEncryption">Encrypting Messages You Can't Decrypt</a>
     section.
    </p>

   </li><li>It's easy to revoke access to one member of a group.  If everyone in a
    group shared a password, it would be very difficult to remove one person's
    access.  A different password might have to be created, and that password
    would have to be communicated securely to <em>all</em> other members of a
    group.  Public-key encryption means that you can control exactly who is
    allowed to read future communications.  If you don't want someone to read
    it, just stop encrypting to that person's public key.  Even if they can
    still see your encrypted communications (like on a public mailing list,)
    they will no longer be able to decrypt it.
  </li></ul>

  <h2><a name="TipsAndTricks">Fun Tips and Tricks</a></h2>
  <p>
   Here are a collection of fun tips and tricks and puzzles for using GPG.
   Please <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">send me more.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a></h3>
  <p>
   This section is optional but important.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   By default, gpg uses weaker encryption algorithms than it could (especially
   if you generated your keys using an older version of the software.)  This is
   to ensure compatibility with older versions.
  </p>

  <p>
   Part of your public key specifies your preferences for the encryption
   algorithms that you want people to use when communicating with you.  These
   are, by default, somewhat weak.  You can view and modify these preferences
   to make your communications stronger.
  </p>

  <p>
   To view all of the algorithms supported by your version of gpg, type:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --version</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   or maybe
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg2 --version</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   This will give an output that looks something like this:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.14<br>

<br>
Home: ~/.gnupg<br>
Supported algorithms:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA192, CAMELLIA256<br>
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224<br>
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2<br>
</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can modify your public key's cipher preferences by interactively
   editing your key:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key <i>your@email.address</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This will display a list of matching public keys.  You may need to enter
   the number of your key in that list so you can edit it.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Hint:</i> You can always type <code>help</code> at the
   <code>gpg&gt;</code> prompt to see all available commands.  There's lots of
   fun stuff hidden in here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Next, show your current algorithm preferences by typing at the
   <code>gpg&gt;</code> prompt:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>showpref</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Which produces something like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>Cipher: AES, TWOFISH, CAST5, BLOWFISH, 3DES<br>
     Digest: RIPEMD160, SHA1<br>
     Compression: ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed<br>
     Features: Keyserver no-modify<br>
   </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The protocols listed first will be used first.  Note that the preferences
   listed are probably not as strong as your copy of GPG supports, and often
   the stronger algorithms are not requested at all!  You can change these
   preferences by calling the <code>setpref</code> command.  I recommend
   something like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>setpref&nbsp;AES256&nbsp;CAMELLIA256&nbsp;AES192&nbsp;CAMELLIA192&nbsp;AES&nbsp;CAMELLIA128&nbsp;TWOFISH&nbsp;CAST5&nbsp;3DES&nbsp;SHA512&nbsp;SHA384&nbsp;SHA256&nbsp;SHA224&nbsp;SHA1&nbsp;RIPEMD160&nbsp;ZLIB&nbsp;BZIP2&nbsp;ZIP&nbsp;Uncompressed</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You may want to add other algorithms that your software supports, or you
   may want to disallow algorithms that you think are too weak.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can see that it worked by typing:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>showpref</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Check this very carefully.  If everything worked right, you can
   <code>save</code>, (in some versions there's just <code>quit</code>) and
   you will be prompted if you want to save your changes: 
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>save</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> You should then re-upload your key to a public key server and
   send it to the people you communicate with.  <em>Until people have imported
    your new key, they will still be using the old algorithms when encrypting
    to your public key!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b> Note that the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/OpenPGP-Key-Management.html">OpenGPG Key Management</a> document states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    "When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order
    which you'd like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a
    message to your key. If you don't include 3DES, it will be automatically
    added at the end. Note that there are many factors that go into choosing
    an algorithm (for example, your key may not be the only recipient), and so
    the remote OpenPGP application being used to send to you may or may not
    follow your exact chosen order for a given message. It will, however, only
    choose an algorithm that is present on the preference list of every
    recipient key."
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b> This means that if you're encrypting to several people at
   the same time, GPG will only use the strongest algorithm that the
   <em>weakest</em> person uses!  <em>Beware when encrypting to multiple
   recipients; one person can (accidentally or intentionally) weaken the
   encryption algorithms used by the whole group!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Corollary:</i>  Don't be the weakest link in your group!  If you are
   still using weak encryption preferences, you are bringing down the security
   of the <em>entire group</em> you're communicating with.  You are not
   weakening the security of your own communications, but those of
   <em>everyone you communicate with!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Corollary:</i>  Inform the weakest links in your group that they could
   be using stronger ciphers.  Point them to this section <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">(Stronger Algorithms)</a> of the documentation
   and help them fix it.  Get their updated public key and help them test their
   preferences using <code>showpref</code> as described above.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Corollary:</i>  <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#UpdatingKeys">Update your keys</a> often, so
   if someone on your keyring chooses to use stronger algorithms, you respect
   their preferences.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <i>Corollary:</i>  If you <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#UpdatingKeys">update the keys</a> of
   people you're sending group messages to, make sure they (or someone else)
   hasn't (intentionally or accidentally) <em>weakened</em> their algorithm
   choices.  Yes, this is painful and hard, but it's one way that an attacker
   might infiltrate your group and degrade your cryptographic algorithms.
   <i>TODO:</i> Write some script that determines who is the weakest link in a
   group?
  </p>
  
  <div class="note">
   <p>
    <b>Technical Note:</b> You may be wondering how these encryption
    algorithms like AES are even relevant to you if you chose to, say,
    generate an RSA or DSA public key.  <em>RSA and DSA are public-key
    encryption algorithms, after all, and AES is a symmetric encryption
    algorithm!  I thought we were using public-key encryption here!</em> The
    answer is that decrypting an encrypted communication in GPG is done in two
    stages, with both public-key and symmetric algorithms being used:
   </p>

   <ol>
    <li><b>Public-key decryption</b>: GPG uses your secret encryption key to
    decrypt a session-only secret key that was encrypted with your public (RSA
    or DSA) key.

    </li><li><b>Symmetric decryption</b>: GPG uses this session-only secret key to
    decrypt the "body" of the message which was encrypted using a symmetric
    algorithm like AES or AES-256.
   </li></ol>

   <p>
    Your public key (RSA or DSA) is only used for the first step.  The actual
    body of the message is encrypted with a (faster) symmetric encryption
    algorithm, so it's important to make sure that you're using strong
    algorithms for both phases.
   </p>
  </div>


  <h3><a name="VerboseInformation">Verbose Information</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can use the <code>-vv</code> command-line option to gpg to give verbose
   output about what algorithms are actually being used. (Note that if you're
   pasting in decrypted text, after you're done pasting, you may need to send
   your operating system's "end-of-file" character.  This is
   <code>Ctrl-D</code> in most Unixlike systems and <code>Ctrl-Z</code> in
   Windows-like systems.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>gpg --list-packets</code> can list the packets of any GPG file and
   give details on what's contained therein.  This tends to output
   not-very-meaningful numeric data about which encryption algorithms were
   used, but you can decode these by looking at the specification for the Open
   PGP standard, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">RFC
    4880</a>, specifically <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-9">Section 9</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also use
   programs like <a href="https://futureboy.us/http/:/www.pgpdump.net/">pgpdump</a> to see what's
   included in a PGP message.
  </p>

  <p>
   Also see the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Automating">Automating GPG</a> section below to see
   more options for dumping detailed information about what GPG is doing.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="MultipleDecrypts">Requiring Multiple Decrypts</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can encrypt documents that require several people must cooperate to
   decrypt, by encrypting with multiple passes, specifying a different
   recipient each time.  They will need to decrypt in the reverse order that
   you encrypted.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>TODO: Make an example, preferably one that writes no intermediate files
   (e.g. output to stdout using <code>--output -</code>) and doesn't make you
   enter passwords multiple times. Naïve versions make gpg complain with
   weird "broken pipe" errors and races in password entry.</i>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="HiddenRecipients">Hidden Recipients</a></h3>
  <p>
   Sometimes you want to hide the recipients of your message from any
   snoopers.  Normally, the key IDs of the recipients are part of the
   message.  However, you can hide these by specifying
   <code>--hidden-recipient&nbsp;<i>recipient</i></code> for each recipient you
   wish to remain hidden (instead of using the <code>-r</code>
   or <code>--recipient</code> flag to specify recipients.)  The decrypting
   program will have to try all available secret keys to try and decrypt the
   message.  (Hidden recipients' key IDs show up as all zeroes in the
   encrypted message.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>--throw-keyids</code> command-line option is essentially the same
   as using <code>--hidden-recipient</code> for all recipients.
  </p>

  <p>
   There are other interesting options for hiding recipients in the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/GPG-Key-related-Options.html">GPG key-related options</a> documentation.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="OneWayEncryption">Encrypting Messages You Can't Decrypt</a></h3>
  <p>
   The section <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Cool">Why Public-Key Encryption is Cool</a> explains
   reasons that you might want to create an encrypted message that you can
   never be compelled to decrypt.  This section discusses how that is
   performed.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="OneWayGPG">In GPG</a></h4>
  <p>
   When you encrypt a message in GPG from the command-line, it does
   <em>not</em> encrypt to you by default!  You would need to specify your
   <em>own</em> e-mail address as a recipient with the <code>-r
    <i>recipient@email.com</i></code> option for you to be able to decrypt it.
  </p>

  <p>
   (See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ManuallyEncrypting">Manually Encrypting for E-mail</a>
   section, including the warning, or the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#EncryptingFiles">Encrypting Files</a> section, including the
   warning.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Thus, there's nothing to do when using gpg on the command-line other than
   remembering <em>not</em> to specify your own e-mail address as a recipient.
   (Note: You can change the "encrypt to self" behavior in your
   <code>gnupg.conf</code> file, so be careful if you've modified that.)
  </p>

  <p>
   This is why I encourage people to learn and use the GPG command-line for
   sensitive communications.  Its defaults are usually safer than what your
   e-mail program exposes to you.  See below for Enigmail (and its problems.)
  </p>

  <h4><a name="OneWayEnigmail">In Enigmail</a></h4>
  <p>
   <b>Global solution:</b> You can turn off encrypting to yourself by default
   from the main Thunderbird menu: <code>Enigmail | Preferences |
   Sending</code> and uncheck <code>Add my own key to the recipients
   list</code>.  <b>Warning:</b> This means that you won't be able to decrypt
   any e-mails you send to <em>anyone</em> after this, until you re-enable
   this setting!  This is a global, persistent setting, not a per-message
   setting!
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Per-message solution:</b> Enigmail currently doesn't seem to support a
   good per-message solution.  The only way to turn off signing to yourself on
   specific messages requires two steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Turn off signing to yourself using the "Global Solution" above.
   </li><li>Make Enigmail prompt you for recipients to encrypt to every time you
    send a message.  To enable this, from the main Thunderbird window, select: <code>Enigmail | Preferences | Key
     Selection | Manually</code>.
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   Then, every time you send an encrypted e-mail, it will pop up a dialog
   which allows you to select which identities on your keyring that you are
   going to encrypt to.  If you <em>do</em> want to encrypt to yourself (so
   you can decrypt and read that message later,) you'll have to manually
   select your own identity in the list.  This is annoying.  Note that if you
   don't perform step 1.) above, <em>Enigmail will still encrypt to you even
   if your name is unchecked in the list!</em>.  Seems like a bug.

  <h3><a name="Migrating">Migrating to a New Key</a></h3>
  <p>
    This section of the document describes the process for migrating to a new
    GPG key, which is two different but related problems:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Creating a new public/secret keypair key for yourself which you will
    then communicate to others.

   </li><li>Updating when someone else generates a new public key.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   These are addressed in the sections below.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="OwnNewKey">Creating Your Own New Key</a></h4>
  <p>
   Sometimes you want to generate a new public key for yourself, and migrate
   away from the old one.  There are a few steps to this process:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><b>Generate the new key.</b>  For this step, you will probably want the
    old and new keys to co-exist on your keyring at the same time.  As noted
    in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> section, you will
    begin the process of creating a new key with:
    
    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --gen-key</code>
    </p>

   </li><li><b>Know your old and new key IDs.</b>  Throughout most of this
    document, you use e-mail addresses to identify keys.  However, once you
    have more than one key for a given e-mail address, things get a bit
    trickier.  GPG behaves somewhat dangerously and uses the <em>first</em>
    secret key in your keyring, unless you explicitly tell it otherwise.
    Thus, you will need to know the key IDs of your old and new keys, and use
    them in the right places below.

    <p>
     You can list your secret keys with:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     or the equivalent:
    </p>
    
    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg -K</code>
    </p>

    <p>(note that that's a capital <code>K</code>.  A lowercase <code>k</code>
     lists all keys.)
    </p>

    <p>
     This produces output something like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">

    </p>

    <p>
     I have highlighted the key IDs in bold.  They appear on a line beginning
     with <code>sec</code>.  As you can see by the creation dates, the old
     key ID is <code>B05676B1</code> and the new key ID is
     <code>ED873D23</code>.  Yours will be different, of course.  Make a note
     of them.
    </p>
    
   </li><li><b>Create a revocation certificate for the new key.</b>  This will let
    you revoke the key if you lose it.  See the directions in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#RevocationKey">Generating a Revocation Key</a> section of the
    documentation, but substitute your <em>new</em> key ID for the e-mail
    address.  You may also want to change the filename if you already have a
    revocation key for your old key.
    
   </li><li><b>Ensure that the new key uses strong cryptography preferences.</b>
    By default, the encryption preferences specified in your public key are
    probably not as strong as they should be.  Follow the procedure in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a> section of the
    documentation, but substitute your new key ID for your e-mail address.
    That is, the command-line will be:

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key <i>newKeyID</i></code>
    </p>

   </li><li><b>Sign the new key with your old key.</b>  If people have your old
    key, this helps them trust that the new key was generated by you.

    <p>When signing a message, the gpg options <code>--local-user
      <i>keyID</i></code> or the equivalent <code>-u <i>keyID</i></code> lets
     you specify which key is doing the signing.  Thus, to sign the new key
     with your old key, you would use the command:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg -u <i>oldKeyID</i> --sign-key <i>newKeyID</i></code>
    </p>

   </li><li><b>(Optional) Trust the old key's signatures.</b>  You may have
    signed other peoples' keys with your old key.  You can tell the new key to
    trust signatures made by the old key using the procedures in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section, specifically the
    <code>trust</code> command.  The command-line may look like:

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg -u <i>newKeyID</i> --interactive --edit-key <i>oldKeyID</i></code>
    </p>
    
    <p>
     And then using the command <code>trust</code> followed by
     <code>save</code>.  (Which in some versions is just <code>quit</code>.)
    </p>
    
   </li><li><b>Set the new key as your default key.</b>  As noted before, GPG uses
    the <em>first</em> secret key in your keyring to sign messages.  You thus
    have a few options to make gpg use your new key by default.  Choose one of
    the options below:

    <ol>
     <li><b>(Recommended)</b> Set the <code>default-key</code> option in your
      <code>gpg.conf</code> file to your new key ID.  (See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Sandbox">Sandbox</a> section to see where your
      <code>gpg.conf</code> file may reside.)  The line in the file will look
      something like:

      <p class="code">
       <code>default-key <i>newKeyID</i></code>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>ENIGMAIL WARNING:</b> Even if you have set this default key, and
       disabled your old key, <em>Enigmail will still use the old, disabled key
        to sign your messages!  It ignores gpg's <code>default-key</code>
        setting and does something very dangerous and wrong to choose the
        signer!  In fact, Enigmail probably ignores <b>all</b> your settings in
        your <code>gpg.conf</code> file and does its own broken, random
        thing.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
       To work around this, you apparently need to tell Enigmail what your new
       key is explicitly.  This setting is hard to find.  The place to
       configure this is currently hidden under each e-mail account on the
       (usually) left-hand side of your screen under <code>OpenPGP
       Security</code> where the option <code>Use specific OpenPGP key
       ID</code> should be checked, and your new key ID entered in the box.
      </p>

      <p>
       Here's the <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/documentation/per-account.php">current
       screenshot from the Enigmail project</a> showing where this setting
       should be configured for each account.
      </p>

      <p>
       <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/list_archive/2008-June/009469.html">This
       e-mail thread</a> from an Enigmail/Mozilla engineer corroborates some
       of this scary, dangerous awfulness.
      </p>

     </li><li><b>(Not recommended)</b> This is ponderous and easy to forget, but
      you can specify the new key ID on the command-line
      with each signing command:  <code>-u <i>newKeyID</i></code>

     </li><li><b>(Optional)</b> Disable the old key in your keyring.  You'd think
      that this should not be necessary if you followed step 1, <em>but be
       warned that GPG and Enigmail will encrypt to the old key ID and sign
       with the old key ID if you specify your e-mail address as one of the
       recipients, as it uses the first key that matches the e-mail
       address.</em>  Ugh.  The command would be:

      <p class="code">
       <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key <i>oldKeyID</i></code>
      </p>
    
      <p>
       And then using the command <code>disable</code> followed by
       <code>save</code>.  (Which in some versions is apparently just
       <code>quit</code>). You can theoretically re-enable it in the future
       using <code>enable</code>.
      </p>

     </li><li><b>(Optional, possibly dangerous)</b> If you're <em>absolutely
       sure</em> that you'll never need the old secret key, you can delete it.
      Keep in mind that this will make it impossible for you to decrypt any old
      communications that were encrypted to the old key!  You probably don't
      want to do this, so I'm not going to tell you how, (but I'll say that
      the <code>help</code> command from the <code>--edit-key</code> mode is
      your friend, and contains lots of interesting tricks.  Take a look!)

      <p>
       Because of the glaring problems and outright bugs in Enigmail and GPG's
       handling of multiple keys for the same e-mail address, it's not a bad
       idea to delete the old key when you can finally be free of it.
      </p>
    </li></ol>
    
   </li><li><b>Communicate the new key to people who have your old key.</b>  One of
    the best ways to do so is to create a migration document that explains
    your reasons, your old and new key information, and sign that message with
    your <em>old</em> key using:

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg -u <i>oldKeyID</i> --clearsign <i>[filename]</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     I have a <a href="https://futureboy.us/gpgmigration.txt">sample migration document</a> that
     you are free to use and modify.
    </p>

   </li><li><b>Import the new signatures from your friends.</b>  People may
    publicly sign your key and return it to you, or upload the signed key to a
    keyserver.  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section of
    the documentation for more information.  Also, be sure to periodically
    refresh your keys from a public keyserver using:

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --refresh-keys</code>
    </p>
    
   </li><li><b>(Optional) Upload the new key to a keyserver.</b>  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Publishing">Publishing your Public Key</a> section for how
    to do this.  This step is important if people have signed your key and
    sent it back directly to you, as their signatures will not appear on
    public keyservers until <em>someone</em> uploads to a keyserver.

   </li><li><b>(Optional, Potentially Dangerous) Revoke the old key.</b> If you
    know what you're doing, you can (and eventually should) revoke the old key.
    Since this is somewhat dangerous, I'm not going to give you explicit steps,
    but <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html#REVOCATION" target="_blank">this section of the GPG guide</a> will get you started.
    (Link opens in new window.)

    <p>
     Revoking a public key is not the end of the world, though.  That guide
     notes that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      "A revoked public key can still be used to verify signatures made by you
      in the past, but it cannot be used to encrypt future messages to you.  It
      also does not affect your ability to decrypt messages sent to you in the
      past if you still do have access to the private key."
     </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
     However, this paragraph is deceptive if not outright wrong!  People
     <em>can and will</em> continue to encrypt future messages to you using
     the revoked key <em>if they don't know about the revocation, and haven't
     updated your key!</em> They will only know about the revocation if they
     periodically refresh your key from a keyserver using something like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --refresh-keys</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Since you have no guarantee that people do that (and few people do it
     regularly, in my experience,) then you need to make sure that you
     communicate the revocation to people you have communicated with in the
     past.  Again, see the "Communicate the new key..." section above for a
     sample document explaining how to do this.
    </p>
  </li></ul>
  
  <h4><a name="OthersNewKey">Using Someone Else's New Public Key</a></h4>
  <p>
   People that you communicate with may generate new public keys, and you need
   to ensure that the new key is valid, and that you are using the new key
   instead of the old key.  There are a few steps to this process:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><b>Import the new key.</b>  If the person emails you the new key
    directly, it should be trivial to import.  Otherwise, you can import it
    with

    <p class="code">
     <code class="input">gpg --import</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     either specifying a filename to read from or pasting the new key in
     directly.  (When you're done pasting, you may need to send your operating
     system's "end-of-file" character.  This is <code>Ctrl-D</code> in most
     Unixlike systems and <code>Ctrl-Z</code> in Windows-like systems.)
    </p>

    <p>
     You may also fetch the new key from a keyserver.  Be sure to read on and
     validate that the person actually uploaded it!
    </p>

   </li><li><b>Know their old and new key IDs.</b>  Once you have multiple keys for
    a person, GPG behaves very badly.  <em>It uses the key for the 
    <b>first</b> e-mail address that matches, and ignores the others!</em>  

   <p>  
    For the next few steps, you will need to know the key IDs for the old and
    the new keys.  You can list all keys associated with their e-mail address
    by doing:
   </p> 

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --list-keys <i>their@email.address</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     or the equivalent:
    </p>
    
    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg -k <i>their@email.address</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     This produces output something like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">

    <p>
     I have highlighted the key IDs in bold.  They appear on a line beginning
     with <code>pub</code>.  As you can see by the creation dates, the old
     key ID is <code>B05676B1</code> and the new key ID is
     <code>ED873D23</code>.  Yours will be different, of course.  Make a note
     of them.  You will need them in the following steps.
    </p>
    
   </li><li><b>Validate the new key with the person.</b>    You should always be
     warned that <em>anyone</em> can generate a public key for <em>any</em>
     e-mail address.  <em>Anyone</em> can post that key to <em>any</em> key
     server, so you need to follow the instructions in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ProcedureForVerification">Procedure for Verification</a> section
     of the document to validate that key with the person!

    <p>
     If the person has signed the new key with the old key, (and they should
     have!) then you can perform another procedure to have a strong certainty
     that whoever is in control of the old key created the new key.  (But if
     the old key was stolen/compromised, you need to be extra careful!)  You
     can check signatures on the new key by running:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --check-sigs <i>newKeyID</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     This will produce output that looks something like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>

    </p>

    <p>
     The exclamation points following <code>sig</code> are the important
     things here. The line in bold, with the old key ID, indicates that the
     old key (which you can identify by the key id you found in an earlier
     step) signed the new key and the exclamation point after
     <code>sig</code> indicates that the signature check passed.  (I know;
     that's horrible user interface.  I'm lobbying to make all of this work
     better.)
    </p>

    <p>
     In Enigmail, you can get to this from <code>Enigmail
    | Key Management</code>, searching for a key, right-clicking on that key,
   and then choosing <code>View Signatures</code>.  You are looking for "Yes"
     in the "Valid" column.
    </p>
    
   </li><li><b>Sign the new key.</b>  Once you have validated the new key with the
    person, you can sign the key.  See the See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section above to see how 
    to sign someone else's key, but note that you'll have to substitute the
    new key ID instead of the e-mail address, or GPG will likely just give you
    the first matching e-mail address (which is the old key):

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key <i>newKeyID</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     And then the <code>sign</code> command, followed by
     <code>save</code>.  (Which in some versions is apparently just
     <code>quit</code>).
    
   </p></li><li><b>(Optional) Send the signed key to its owner.</b>  Again, see the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section above to see how 
    to sign someone else's key and export it for e-mailing, or to send it to a
    keyserver.
    
   </li><li><b>Delete or disable the old key.</b> Since you now have both keys on
    your keyring and you no longer want to accidentally use the old key, you
    should delete or disable the old key.

    <p>
     With all the problems with GPG and Enigmail's handling of multiple keys
     for the same e-mail address, deleting it is by far the safest option, but
     simply disabling it means that it <em>should</em> no longer be used for
     encryption (although the bugs listed above for Enigmail leave me with
     little confidence in its ability to choose the right key.)  However, GPG
     may still trust signatures made by a disabled key, so if the other
     person's old key was stolen (and not revoked) then you might be at risk
     of accidentally trusting it!
    </p>

    <p>
     To disable or delete the old key, do:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key <i>oldKeyID</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Check that you have the correct key, and then type either
     <code>disable</code> or <code>delete</code>.  After that, type
     <code>save</code> and save your changes.
    </p>

    <p>
     Note that some versions of GPG appear not to have a <code>delete</code>
     command from the interactive menu, so you may have to do something like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --delete-keys <i>oldKeyID</i></code>
    </p>

    <p><b>From Enigmail:</b>  From within Enigmail, you can disable or delete
     a key by the following:  <code>Enigmail | Key Management</code>.  Search

  <h3><a name="KeysigningParty">Keysigning Party</a></h3>
  <p>
   A keysigning party is just a bunch of repetitions of the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ProcedureForVerification">Procedure for Verification</a> described
   above.  You meet other people, validate their identities, and exchange
   fingerprints of your public keys.  Later, usually after the party, you can
   download their public keys from a keyserver, verify that the fingerprint
   you got from the person matches the one you downloaded from the keyserver,
   and then sign the key and send the signed key to its owner.  You don't need
   to (and are often warned not to) bring a computer to the keysigning party,
   as long as you are prepared using the guidelines below:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><b>Before the keysigning party:</b>

    <ol>
     <li>Print out a bunch of copies of your public key's
      <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Fingerprint">fingerprint</a> on strips of paper.  Keep them
      safely in your possession until the keysigning party:

      <p class="code">
       <code>gpg --fingerprint <i>your@email.address</i></code>
      </p>

      <p>
       It may look something like this (I've put the fingerprint, name, and
       e-mail address in bold.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="code">
       <code>

      </p>

     </li><li>Bring a pen, some paper, and a photo ID.  You may wish to obscure

      painter's tape works well for this.

      3! You're ready!  If your public key <em>isn't</em> listed on a
      keyserver, then either <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Publishing">publish it to one</a> or,
      (less friendly,) provide a way for others to download it.  (Say, by
      publishing a URL on the paper that contains your fingerprint.)  I
      definitely <em>don't</em> recommend exchanging flash drives at a
      keysigning party!
    </li></ol>

   </li><li><b>During the keysigning party:</b>

    <p>
     For each person you meet at the keysigning party:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
     <li>Exchange paper copies of your fingerprints.  You should both give and
      receive one, but it does not necessarily have to be symmetrical.  (If you
      run out of pieces of paper, you can always copy fingerprints by hand, or
      take a picture of one, etc.)

     </li><li>Attempt to validate the other person's identity, usually by asking to
      see their photo id if you don't know them otherwise.  Be courteous.  You
      don't have to share your ID with anyone you don't want to, and they don't
      have to share with you.  Again, it's good to mask out sensitive details
      on your ID, (like with blue painter's tape.)

     </li><li>Once the identity is validated, sign or initial the fingerprint you
      received from them, and keep it in a secure place.  You will need it
      later.

     </li><li>(Optional)  Go around the room in a group with people you know.  If
      you personally know someone that you're exchanging keys with, let your
      friends know that, and ask them to do the same.  Introduce each other.
      It enhances the trust level.

     </li><li>(Optional)  Ask the person if they have a photo of themself in their
      public key.  (You can attach a small photo to your public key, which
      makes it harder to impersonate you in person.)  If they do, you might
      ask to take a picture of them to compare with the picture in the public
      key later.
    </li></ul>
    
   </li><li><b>After the keysigning party:</b>
    <p>
     <em>After</em> the keysigning party is when you usually do the actual
     signing of keys.  For each person that you met:
    </p>

    <ol>
     <li><b>Import their public key from a keyserver.</b> Again, note that the
      last 8 or 16 hexadecimal digits of the fingerprint are their short or
      long public key ID, respectively.  For example, if all you have is the
      fingerprint:

      <p class="code">
       <code>EC23 92F2 EDE7 4488 680D&nbsp;&nbsp;A3CF 5F2B 4756 ED87 3D23</code>
      </p>

      <p>
       Then you can instantly determine the short key ID, which is the last 8
       hexadecimal digits of that fingerprint (removing spaces), which gives
       <code>ED873D23</code>.  (The long key ID is the last 16 digits.)
      </p>

      <p>
       With just that number, you can request their public key from a
       keyserver:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
       <code>gpg --recv-keys <i>keyID</i></code>
      </p>

      <p>
       You will see something like:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
       <code>
        gpg: requesting key ED873D23 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net<br>
        gpg: key ED873D23: public key "Alan Eliasen &lt;eliasen@mindspring.com&gt;" imported<br>
        gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model<br>
        gpg: depth: 0  valid:   2  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u<br>
        gpg: Total number processed: 1<br>
        gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)<br>
       </code>
      </p>


      <p>
       (You can even fetch public keys from keyservers using all 40 digits of
       the full fingerprint (with spaces removed, and you may now have to
       prepend <code>0x</code> onto the fingerprint) but people usually use the
       short key ID because it's easier to type from a piece of paper.  You
       will still verify the <em>full</em> fingerprint in the next steps.)
      </p>

      <p>
       You can also search for keys by e-mail address instead of key ID, using
       <code>gpg --search-keys <i>their@email.address</i></code> but if
       you don't even have the e-mail address, the fingerprint alone is
       sufficient.
      </p>

      <p>
       (Note that with just an 8-hex-digit short key ID, it's possible that
       there may be key collisions when downloading from a keyserver.  You can
       reduce this possibility by using the 16- or 40-bit fingerprint.  See
       the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ShortKeyID">Short key IDs are Bad News</a> section of
       this document if you want to know more about key collisions.)
      </p>

     </li><li><b>Generate the local fingerprint of the key you imported</b>.  This
      verifies that the public key you received has the proper fingerprint:

      <p class="code">
       <code>gpg --fingerprint <i>keyID</i></code>
      </p>

      <p>
       Again, you could also search by e-mail address instead of key ID.  See
       the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Fingerprint">Fingerprint</a> section of this document to
       see how to verify fingerprints in Enigmail.
      </p>

     </li><li><b>Verify that this fingerprint matches the one you have on
       paper.</b> You just do this with your eyes, comparing the
      40-hexadecimal-digit numbers.

     </li><li><b>Sign the key</b> if everything matches.  See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a Key</a> section for detailed information
      on how to do this. You may sign the key publicly or locally.  Signing the
      key tells your cryptographic software that you've validated the other
      person's identity and that your software no longer has to warn you that
      the key has not been properly verified and trusted.

      <p>
       Since you have the key ID, the best way to generate the fingerprint,
       sign, and trust the key is to edit it interactively using a command
       like:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
       <code>gpg --interactive --edit-key <i>keyID</i></code>
      </p>

      <p>
       and then using the commands <code>sign</code> (which will show you the
       fingerprint, you can also generate it with <code>fpr</code> and
       <code>trust</code> followed by <code>save</code> or <code>quit</code>.
       <i>Hint:</i> Type <code>help</code> for the interactive commands.
      </p>

     </li><li><b>If you've publicly signed the key, return the signed key to its
       owner.</b> This allows them to import your signature and share that
      signature with others.  Again, see the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#SigningAKey">Signing a
       Key</a> section of this document for ways to do this.
      
      <p>
       In some circles, it may be considered more courteous to email the
       signed key back to its owner rather than to upload the signed key back
       to a keyserver directly, but be warned that <em>anyone</em> can sign
       <em>any</em> key and upload it to any keyserver, so someone may do this
       without your knowledge or consent. In short, exporting the key for
       e-mailing back to its owner will probably look something like:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
       <code>
        gpg --armor --export <i>keyID</i>
       </code>
      </p>

      <p>
       and then emailing that output to the owner of the key.
      </p>

      <p>
       On the other hand, you may not want to send an unnecessary encrypted
       message, so you can upload the signed key directly to a keyserver
       using:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
       <code>
        gpg --send-keys <i>keyID</i>
       </code>
      </p>

      <p>
       Again, be warned that the key's owner and other people will not see
       or know about that signature until they do:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
       <code>gpg --refresh-keys</code>
      </p>
    </li></ol>

   </li><li><b>When you receive your own signed key from others, import it.</b>
    See the detailed steps in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ImportingAKey">Importing a Key</a>
    section of the documentation above.

   </li><li>
    <b>Periodically publish your newly-signed key to a keyserver.</b>  As you
    get new signatures, publish them to a keyserver.  See the
    detailed steps in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Publishing">Publishing your Public Key</a>
    section of the documentation above.  Most people won't see the new
    signatures until they're published to a keyserver!
    
   </li><li>
    <b>Periodically refresh keys from a keyserver.</b> See the detailed steps
    in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#UpdatingKeys">Updating Keys</a> section of the
    documentation above to collect all the new signatures from the keysigning
    party.  You may find that other people have signed your key and uploaded
    them directly to the keyserver.  This also helps you collect the web of
    signatures from all the people who were at the keysiging party.

    <p>
     In a nutshell, you can do this with:
    </p>
    
    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg --refresh-keys</code>
    </p>

   </li><li><b>For fun, look at all your new signatures!</b>  You can list the
    signatures using:

    <p class="code">
     <code class="input">gpg --list-sigs <i>your@email.address</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     If you see signatures that have <code>[User ID not found]</code> you
     might have better luck examining your key at <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">pgp.mit.edu</a> or <a href="https://sks-keyservers.net/">sks-keyservers.net</a>.

  <h2><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="NoDetect">GPG Doesn't Detect a Message</a></h3>
  <p>
   I'm often asked: "somebody sent me a GPG message (or private key) and GPG
   can't import it (or says it's empty.)  What is wrong?"
  </p>

  <p>
   It's often the fault of a poorly-behaved email program corrupting the
   ASCII-armored body of the message.  The OpenPGP standard requires exact
   formatting of a message.  Here are several things you want to check in an
   ASCII-armored message, in approximate order of importance, the most
   important listed first:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Make sure that the message contains <code>BEGIN</code> <em>and</em>
    <code>END</code> block markers that look <em>exactly</em> like some of the
    following.  These lines are a critical part of a GPG-encrypted message!
    Don't forget to cut and paste them as part of a message:

    <p class="code">
     <code>-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----</code><br>
     <code>-----END PGP MESSAGE-----</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     or, for a public key:
    </p>
    
    <p class="code">
     <code>-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</code><br>
     <code>-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Without these, gpg might give an error like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.</code><br>
     <code>gpg: processing message failed: eof</code>
    </p>

   </li><li>Make sure the <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> lines are on a
    line by themselves.

   </li><li>Make sure the <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> lines begin
    <em>and</em> end with <em>exactly</em> 5 hyphens.

   </li><li>Make sure the <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> lines have no
    leading spaces.  (Trailing spaces are usually tolerated, but leading
    spaces absolutely are not.  No lines should have leading spaces.)

   </li><li>Make sure that those 5 hyphens are really hyphens (ASCII decimal code
    45, hexadecimal 0x2D).

    <p>It's common for poorly-behaved mail and web publishing platforms to
     turn all or some of those pairs of hyphens into different, wider
     "em-dashes" or other incorrect Unicode characters which will make gpg
     unable to recognize the header blocks.  Make sure you have so-called
     "smart quotes" turned off in your mail client or HTML editor when cutting
     or pasting in cryptographic material.  (Actually, always turn off "smart
     quotes" everywhere if you want to look smart.  I've never seen smart
     quotes do anything smart.)
    </p>

   </li><li>Make sure there is a blank line after the <code>BEGIN</code> line and
    before the base-64 encoded cryptographic material.  This is required!
    Anything before the first blank line is treated as directives to GPG, such
    as comments or character sets to be used in the decryption.

    <p>
     For example, my public key block begins:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br>
Version: GnuPG v1<br>
Comment: See Alan's GPG guide at https://futureboy.us/pgp.html<br>
<br>
mQINBFPOzTUBEADT1kIEMY1Ix+9DyNfGHE9HPjLSI/Ybnsn/bbx8cWmeAktoYjBS<br>
q29mJ0tchjyG8KP38vlkvfNYKn80985a/p7ZKupxOm1dDyAn5TZguDG2fEgCYxcB<br>
</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     But the message could eliminate the comments and version number and look
     like:
    </p>
    
    <p class="code">
     <code>-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br>
<br>
mQINBFPOzTUBEADT1kIEMY1Ix+9DyNfGHE9HPjLSI/Ybnsn/bbx8cWmeAktoYjBS<br>
q29mJ0tchjyG8KP38vlkvfNYKn80985a/p7ZKupxOm1dDyAn5TZguDG2fEgCYxcB<br>
</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Note the <em>required</em> blank line before the base-64-encoded material
     in both cases!
    </p>

    <p>
     Without a blank line before the base-64-encoded body, gpg may give an
     error like:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
     <code>gpg: invalid armor header: <i>[the first line of the body]</i></code>
    </p>

    <p>
     This error happens commonly when people use web publishing platforms and
     cut and paste their key in.  The publishing platform (or the misguided
     human editor) often loses this crucial blank line.  When publishing
     gpg-encoded material in HTML, it's safest to wrap it in a
     <code>&lt;PRE&gt;</code> ... <code>&lt;/PRE&gt;</code> block and don't
     let your editor touch it in any way.

   </p></li><li>Make sure the next-to-last line is on a line by itself if necessary.
    For example, my public key block ends:

    <p class="code">
     <code>w0FuP9jjl8eYgSZl9tqaU6Y9vDyXzE0h6F4SUPiBx3hEIrVzFJym0d6/t562bstQO<br>
     pIPGkZxLOFm59msUf9mBqw7rJEs/EqhQ2w==<br>
=7DhM<br>
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br>
</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     The last line that looks something like <code>=7DhM</code> should be on a
     line by itself.  The line before it is allowed to end with zero, one or
     two equals signs as per the normal base-64 encoding algorithm.  Some
     editors or linewrapping algorithms smash these together and make them
     ambiguous.
    </p>

   </li><li>Make sure lines are wrapped reasonably.  By default, gpg wraps
    ASCII-armored lines to 64 characters.  While it can handle other lengths,
    email programs will sometimes append lines to each other and can join or
    break lines (especially headers with hyphens) that are intended to be
    separate single lines.  Mobile-phone-based e-mail clients with narrow
    screens are some of the worst culprits for badly wrapping lines.
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   <i>Corollary:</i> When publishing your public key to the Web or other
   places, <em>test that you can <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ImportingAKey">import it back</a>
   into GPG!</em>  I don't know how many journalists I've seen who publish
   broken public keys because they've broken one or more of the rules above.
   Don't let your editor or web designer break your key!  If you are a
   journalist who is publishing your public key, please <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">tell me the place you published it and
   let me test it for you</a>.  (I will righteously berate your web designer
   if they don't know the proper usage of a <code>&lt;PRE&gt;</code>
   ... <code>&lt;/PRE&gt;</code> block or, better, an
   unmodifiable-by-JavaScript text file.  They could kill people if they don't
   understand this.)
  </p>

  <p>
   To fix any of these problems, you may need to save the ASCII-armored
   message you received and fix it up by hand in your favorite text editor,
   and then pass that file to gpg, either using the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ImportingAKey">importing a key</a> method (for public keys) or <a href="https://futureboy.us/ManuallyDecrypting">manually decrypting</a> method for encrypted
   material.
  </p>

  <p>
   If someone is sending you broken ASCII-armored material, please <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#NoDetect">point them to this section of this page</a> and help them
   fix the problem, and communicate more reliably with others.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="HTMLEmails">HTML Emails</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you are sending or receiving encrypted material in an HTML-formatted
   email, or a <code>multipart/alternative</code> email, <em>then that is
    almost certainly the problem!</em>  Fix this first.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Solution:</b>  Always email all encrypted content as simple ASCII text.
   Not HTML, not <code>multipart/alternative</code>.  Only plain text.  Go fix
   your emailer's settings now.
  </p>

  <p>
   I have not yet seen an encrypted email message sent in HTML or in (HTML and
   plaintext) that is not problematic or outright broken.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sometimes it's only half-broken; if you view the mail as plaintext, it
   works, but if you view the mail as HTML, it's broken.  Sometimes the
   opposite is true.  Sometimes both are broken.  (In my experience, both
   never work.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Rule of thumb:</i> If the people writing your email/encryption software
   don't go to great lengths to prevent you from sending HTML-formatted
   emails, they really can't be trusted to do the right thing.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
   <p><b>Technical Note:</b>  Modern email specifications allow you to send an
    email in both simple, human-readable plaintext, and in computer-readable
    HTML.  This is indicated by an email header that says something like:
   </p>

   <p class="code">
    <code>Content-Type: multipart/alternative</code>
   </p>

   <p>
    And then the body can contain sections of different MIME types, like one
    for plain text, and one for HTML.  The incredibly dangerous and stupid
    part about this is that the sections can contain utterly different
    things.  The plain text section can say "You have <b>WON</b> the lottery"
    and the HTML section can say "You have <b>LOST</b> the lottery".
   </p>

   <p>
    These never work right.  Here are some common problems:
   </p>

   <ul>
    <li>The <code>text/plain</code> section is blank, and your recipient who
     chooses to see <code>text/plain</code> sees nothing.  (This is common
     with lots of bad e-mail spammers.)

    </li><li>The HTML section is wrapped differently from the
     <code>text/plain</code> section.  <em>A signature will
      not validate if the lines are wrapped differently than it was originally
      written.</em>  This is incredibly common.

    </li><li>Lines are wrapped in one version, not wrapped in another.

    </li><li>Lines are broken up with &lt;P&gt; tags in the HTML which causes blank
     lines to appear between lines or paragraphs when you try to paste into
     gpg.  Which then (correctly) fails to decrypt.

    </li><li>The spammer can use HTML to make a link show one place, and go to a
     completely different place.
   </li></ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>
   I could go on for days and days about how HTML-formatted encrypted content
   is bad and wrong.  Go fix your mailer to stop sending HTML-formatted
   encrypted content.  (Then go fix your mailer to send <em>any</em>
   HTML-formatted content.)
  </p>

  <p>
   It's even worse if your mailer encrypts a document that it has already
   formatted in HTML.  HTML has lots of repetitive and predictable
   "boilerplate" that facilitates "known-plaintext" attacks.  Read the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#GoodPractices">Good Encryption Practices</a> section of this
   document to see why that's dangerous.
  </p>

  <p>
   As a wise guru once said, "there are two types of emails:  plain text and
   wrong."  This is especially true for encrypted content.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="SendItToYourself">Send it to Yourself</a></h3>
  <p>
   Before you start sending encrypted e-mails, or public keys, to other
   people, <em>send them to yourself!</em>  And try to decrypt or import them
   yourself!  If they don't work for you, they will certainly not work for
   anyone else!
  </p>

  <p>
   You should try these things:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Send your public key to yourself. (See the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#ManualExporting">Manual Exporting</a> section of this document.)
    You can (and should) try to re-import your own public key.  Re-importing
    your own public key multiple times will not harm anything.  In fact, you
    should practice doing this, because someone may send you your own private
    key with their signature added to it.  If you cannot re-import your own
    public key, then something is wrong with your process.
    
   </li><li>Send an email to yourself and try to decrypt it.  If you can't, nobody
    else will be able to either!

   </li><li>If you publish your public key on a webpage, <em>try to import it back
     to yourself!</em>  I can not stress this enough to journalists who publish
    broken keys on their websites.  Usually they can fix this with <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#NoDetect">these troubleshooting hints</a>.

  <h3><a name="ShortKeyID">Short Key IDs Are Bad News</a></h3>
  <p>
   As mentioned above, key IDs are usually specified as 8-character
   hexadecimal strings.  This is actually the last digits of your 40-digit
   fingerprint. With only 8<sup>16</sup> (which is a bit over 4 billion)
   unique short key IDs, there is a probability that there are collisions of
   short key IDs in public key servers.  That probability is 1, as we know
   collisions occur.  (The probability is infinitesimally close to 1 in
   mathematical analysis.)
  </p>

  <p>
    With (at the time of this writing) over 3 million keys in public
    keyservers, (obtained from <a href="https://sks-keyservers.net/status/">the
    sks-keyservers status pages</a>) there are likely many collisions.  One
    would first expect to see a collision with only about 82,000 keys in the
    keyserver.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mathematics of finding the probability of collisions can be found in
    the
    Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack">Birthday 
    Attack</a> article.
  </p>

  <p>
   There's more information in the interesting article
   <a href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/short-key-ids-are-bad-news.html">Short
   Key IDs are bad news (with OpenPGP and GNU Privacy Guard)</a> which
   demonstrates real instances of key ID collisions.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Warning</b>: In fact, as a proof of concept, the folks at <a href="https://evil32.com/">Evil 32</a> have generated a full copy of the GPG
   "strong set" with faked 8-character key IDs <em>and faked signatures</em>,
   which have been now uploaded to the public keyservers (presumably by
   someone else.)  You <em>will</em> find collisions with short key IDs, and
   finding longer collisions is possible with tools like <a href="https://github.com/lachesis/scallion">scallion</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Summary:</i> Use the entire fingerprint to communicate your key ID, or
   to fetch it from keyservers.  The 8- or 16-digit keys are simply the last 8
   or 16 hexadecimal digits of the fingerprint.  Read on to find out how to
   find that ID.
  </p>


  <h3><a name="LongerKeyID">Finding Your Longer Key ID</a></h3>
  <p>
    By default, GPG only shows 8-hex-character key IDs when you do something
    like:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --list-keys eliasen@mindspring.com</code><br><br>
   <code class="output">
pub   4096R/<b>ED873D23</b> 2014-07-22<br>

sub   4096R/5314E70B 2014-07-22<br>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can change this to get long or short keys using the
   <code>--keyid-format
    <i>short</i>|<i>0xshort</i>|<i>long</i>|<i>0xlong</i></code> option.
  </p><p>

  </p><p class="code">
   <code class="input">

   </code>

   <br><br>

   <code class="output">

sub   4096R/11C2E18C5314E70B 2014-07-22<br>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can get your also 16-hex-character key ID in a more computer-parseable one-line format using the <code>--with-colon</code> option:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">
    gpg --fingerprint --with-colon <i>your@email.com</i>
   </code>

   <br><br>
   
   <code class="output">

   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    The public key is the line that begins with <code>pub</code>.  You can
    automate the extraction with (on a Linux-like system):
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --fingerprint --with-colon <i>email@address.com</i>
   | grep '^pub' | cut -d: -f5,10</code><br><br>
  <code class="output">5F2B4756ED873D23:Alan Eliasen&nbsp;&lt;eliasen@mindspring.com&gt;</code> 
  </p>

  <p>
   However, read on to see a more common way to find the 16-hex-character key
   ID using only the fingerprint.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="KeyIDsHash">Key IDs and Hash Algorithms</a></h3>
  <p>
    You might not have noticed that your key ID is the final digits of
    the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#Fingerprint">fingerprint</a> of your key.  It took me a long
    time to realize that.
  </p>

  <p>
    A fingerprint is usually the SHA-1 hash of a key, which is 160 bits, or 20
    bytes, or 40 hexadecimal characters.  
  </p>

  <p>
   Your short key ID is the last 8 hexadecimal digits of your fingerprint.
   Your long key ID is the last 16 hexadecimal digits of your fingerprint.  So
   you can always find the long or short key ID if you have someone's full
   fingerprint, but you can and should always use the full fingerprint to
   import from a keyserver.
  </p>

  <p>
   You should always use the full fingerprint to receive keys from a
   keyserver, or to communicate your key ID with others.  (You may now have to
   prepend <code>0x</code> to the fingerprint for commands like
   <code>--search-keys</code> to work correctly.)  For example, to receive my
   key from a keyserver, you should use my full fingerprint something like
   this.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys EC2392F2EDE74488680DA3CF5F2B4756ED873D23
  </p>

  <h3><a name="BadGnome">Enigmail, gpg-agent, and Gnome keyring bugs</a></h3>
  <p>
   This section describes workarounds for Fedora Linux (and perhaps other
   Gnome and Mate environments) where Enigmail apparently remembers passwords
   forever, even if you don't want it to.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   I noticed that Enigmail never expired my gpg passphrase, even when I told
   it to expire after 2 minutes of idle time.  Even worse, it would then
   <em>automatically and silently</em> decrypt PGP/MIME messages when I tried
   to view them, even though I told Enigmail to <em>not</em> automatically
   decrypt.  That's dangerous.  If an attacker adds lot of attachments, they
   can mount known-cryptext attacks and recover your entire signing key, even
   with an <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/">acoustic
    attack</a> that never touches your computer!
  </p><p>

  </p><p>
   Update:  This is apparently a known bug, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/bugs/287/">Enigmail Bug #287</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   I thought this was related to <code>gpg-agent</code>, which sometimes
   handles passphrase input, so I tried putting the following into a new
   <code>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> file to tell it to forget passwords
   after 60 seconds:
  </p><p>

  </p><p class="code">
   <code>default-cache-ttl 60</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   However, that didn't work.  I tried switching off "use gpg-agent for
   passphrases" in the Enigmail advanced preferences, but that didn't work
   either.
  </p>

  <p>
   After further research, I found out that the Gnome and/or Mate desktop
   environments were setting up their <em>own</em> GPG keyring daemons which
   just weren't behaving well.  (These processes may be called
   <code>gnome-keyring-daemon</code> and/or <code>mate-keyring-daemon</code>.
   Note that this same process name may be controlling your ssh keys as well,
   so you may not want to kill them outright.  Read on.)  These can be turned
   off in Fedora's main menu by going to <code>System | Preferences | Startup
   Applications| Startup Programs</code> and unchecking <code>GPG Password
   Agent: Gnome Keyring: GPG Agent</code> and since I'm running Mate, also
   unchecking <code>GPG Password Agent: Mate Keyring: GPG Agent</code>.
   (There are probably lots of other things you might want to turn off in
   there.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Enigmail then wouldn't talk to <code>gpg-agent</code> usefully so I cut it
   out of the loop also.  I disabled "use gpg-agent for passphrases" in the
   Enigmail advanced preferences.  After that, Enigmail popped up its own gpg
   key dialog, and everything worked just fine, with Enigmail forgetting the
   passphrase after the specified time.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that this may not work just fine if you're using <code>gpg2</code>,
   which may require the use of gpg-agent, so you may have to work harder to
   set that agent up correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
   Please let me know if you have better workarounds.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Automating">Automating GPG</a></h3>
  <p>
    If you're automating things, you can specify the password for encryption
    and decryption with the <code>--passphrase&nbsp;<i>password</i></code>
    command-line option.  Note that the password may get stored in your
    command history, will be visible in a process list, etc., so this is
    generally a Bad Idea.  You can mitigate this somewhat with the
    <code>--passphrase-file <i>filename</i></code> option.  Just protect that
    file!  <b>Note:</b> In gpg2 and possibly some versions of gpg, you will
    have to specify the <code>--batch</code> option for gpg2 to actually use
    those passwords or passphrases!  It doesn't hurt to specify it in these
   cases.  The <code>--batch</code> option also prevents gpg from popping up a
   password entry field or anything requiring human interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
   Signing a key with <code>--sign-key</code> still prompts you if you really
   want to sign, even with <code>--batch</code> and a passphrase, but you can
   add the <code>--yes</code> option to automatically choose "yes" to the
   prompts.
  </p>

  <p>
   The gpg program usually sends a lot of status information to standard error
   (stderr) but you might want that output directed elsewhere, or sent to a
   file.  The <code>--logger-file&nbsp;<i>filename</i></code> or
   <code>--logger-fd&nbsp;<i>filedescriptor</i></code> will redirect that
   output.
  </p>

  <p>
   For more machine-parseable output, there's a status file that can be
   written using the <code>--status-file&nbsp;<i>filename</i></code> or
   <code>--status-fd&nbsp;<i>filedescriptor</i></code> options.  This gives
   lines that indicate details of what was found in the message, what was
   tried, and the detailed status of each step.  More details about this
   output can be found in the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/Unattended-Usage.html#Unattended-Usage">Unattended Usage</a> section of the GPG documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
   For more fun, here are some <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/GPG-Esoteric-Options.html">Esoteric GPG Options</a> that you may need to know to automate GPG.
  </p>

  <p>
   Read on to the next section to see how to specify where gpg stores its
   configuration files and keys.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Sandbox">Making a Sandbox / Multiple keyrings</a></h3>
  <p>
   Often, you'll want to experiment with GPG without actually making changes
   to your primary keyring.  You can easily create a "sandbox" to make changes
   to a completely separate keyring.  GPG looks at the <code>GNUPGHOME</code>
   environment variable to see where to read its public and private keys from.
   (On Linux-like systems this defaults to <code>~/.gnupg</code> while on
   Windows it's stuffed away in the (possibly hidden) directories:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application
     Data\GnuPG</code><br>
   or<br>
   <code>C:\Users\<i>username</i>\Application Data\GnuPG</code><br>
   or<br>
   <code>C:\Users\<i>username</i>\AppData\Roaming\GnuPG</code><br>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b>  If different versions of Windows or GPG on other platforms
   store your keyrings in different locations, please <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">let me know</a> and I'll add it here.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want to make multiple keyrings, set this
   environment variable before running your gpg commands.  (e.g. in a Linux
   shell, <code>export&nbsp;GNUPGHOME=/directory/of/your/keyring</code> or in
   a Windows command prompt,
   <code>set&nbsp;GNUPGHOME=c:\directory\of\your\keyring</code> and 
   then subsequent commands in that shell will use your "sandbox" keyring.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that gpg will check the permissions on that folder and operations that
   call external programs (like connecting to a keyserver) will be disallowed
   if others can write to that directory.  In a Unix-like system, you can fix
   that with:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
    <code>chmod&nbsp;700&nbsp;$GNUPGHOME</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   For example, in Linux, you can create a whole new keyring for automated
   processes:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">#!/bin/sh<br>
    export GNUPGHOME=/directory/of/your/keyring<br>
    <br>
    # Following commands in this shell will use that home<br>
    gpg --import file1
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Alternately, you can pass the <code>--homedir&nbsp;<i>dir</i></code> option
   to gpg on the command-line with each command.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ForcingAlgorithms">Forcing Different Algorithms</a></h3>
  <p>
   First, read the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a>
   section above to see how to configure gpg to prefer that people use certain
   algorithms when sending to you.  That section is probably more important
   than this one.  It's far more important that you and the person you're
   talking to use the recommendations in the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a> section above.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   GPG contains many different encryption and hashing algorithms.  You can get
   a list of the included algorithms with the command:
  </p>
  
  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --version</code><br><br>

  </p>

  <p>
   When manually encrypting, (either with public-key encryption or symmetric
   encryption,) you can specify an encryption algorithm with the
   <code>--personal-cipher-preferences&nbsp;"<i>alg1&nbsp;alg2...</i>"</code> option and a digest/hashing
   algorithm using the <code>--personal-digest-preferences&nbsp;"<i>alg1&nbsp;alg2...</i>"</code> option:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code class="input">gpg --armor --personal-cipher-preferences "AES256
    AES192 AES" --personal-digest-preferences "SHA512 SHA256 SHA1" -r
    <i>recipient1@email.address</i> --encrypt <i>filename</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You really need to know what you're doing to use these, though.  See the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/OpenPGP-Options.html">GPG Protocol-Specific Options page</a> for more.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Expert tip:</b> If you really want to force the algorithm used, you can
   use the <code>--cipher-algo <i>name</i></code> command-line switch for
   symmetric or public-key encryption.  The
   <code>--personal-cipher-preferences</code> options above should be used if
   you don't want to accidentally violate the OpenPGP specification.  You can
   use the <code>--cipher-algo <i>name</i></code> argument if you know that
   your recipient has a modern version of GPG but doesn't have their public
   key set up well.  Again, encourage them to improve their public key using
   the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger Algorithms</a> section
   above.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="ProtectingSecretKeys">Protecting your Secret Keys</a></h3>
  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b> This section is somewhat speculative and may not help you
   really improve your security against a sophisticated attacker, but may help
   defeat some threat models.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Your secret keys are, by default, encrypted with older encryption
   algorithms (CAST5) and hashing algorithms (SHA-1, iterated over 65,536
   rounds).  You can modify these preferences, though.
  </p>

  <p>
   You must use a strong password to protect your secret keys.  This is the
   weakest link of your security.  If someone is able to obtain your secret
   key files, they can mount a brute-force attack on it by testing many
   passwords in a dictionary attack.  If you want to make it harder to perform
   a naïve brute-force attack on your secret keys, you can change the
   encryption algorithm and increase the number of rounds that are necessary
   to decrypt and validate your secret key.  One way of doing this is to
   change the password for your secret key with something like the following:
  </p>

  <p class="code">
   <code>gpg&nbsp;--interactive&nbsp;--s2k-cipher-algo&nbsp;AES256&nbsp;--s2k-digest-algo&nbsp;SHA512&nbsp;--s2k-mode&nbsp;3&nbsp;--s2k-count&nbsp;65000000&nbsp;--edit-key&nbsp;<i>keyID</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   and then changing the password using the <code>passwd</code> command,
   saving/quitting using <code>save</code> and saving the changes.
  </p>

  <p>
   This forces your secret key to be encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm,
   SHA-512 hashing, and the mode is iterated and salted.  The count means that
   the hash will be applied 65 million times (which is about the maximum
   allowed.)  This will greatly slow down the decryption of your secret key
   (it takes about a second on my computer, but that's rarely a problem,)
   which might significantly slow down attackers attempting to brute-force
   your password.  Reduce the count if you need to decrypt many messages very
   quickly, as you will encounter a noticeable delay every time you decrypt a
   message!
  </p>

  <div class="note">
   <p><b>Technical Note:</b> <code>s2k</code> is short for "string to key".
    This refers to an algorithm that turns a textual string (<i>i.e.</i> your
    password) into an <i>n</i>-bit number that can be used as a cryptographic
    key.  (For example, AES-256 requires a 256-bit-long key.  Your password is
    probably not that long, nor evenly distributed bitwise, so these functions
    try to turn a shorter string into a well-distributed longer key.)
   </p>
  </div>

  <p>
   The more expensive that you make attacks on your secret keys, the better.
   This may not protect you against the highest-level attackers, nor will it
   prevent attacks directly against the symmetrically-encrypted parts of your
   message (see the <a href="https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms">Using Stronger
   Algorithms</a> section above to improve this,) but it will certainly
   discourage someone who has obtained your secret keyring and is trying to
   brute-force the password (say, by using the password-generating features of
   <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a> and passing
   them into the GPG executable.)  This will slow down the speed of password
   cracking by many orders of magnitude, which is often enough to make
   brute-force attacks greatly infeasible.
  </p>

  <p>
   More information at Christopher Wellons's excellent <a href="http://nullprogram.com/blog/2012/06/24/">blog entry</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   In the OpenPGP standard, the number of iterations is actually coerced into
   a single byte, so not all numbers of iterations are possible.  Here's more
   information about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuPG/comments/21njsb/s2kcount_illegal_numbers/">equation and valid values</a> for <code>--s2k-count</code>.

  </p><p>
   There is <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/15632/what-is-purpose-of-s2k-gnupg-options">some
   dispute</a> if these particular options are the best, so do your research.
   For example, AES algorithms are designed to be fast, so a slower algorithm
   might actually be better if you're trying to slow down attackers.
  </p>

  <p>
   It is also possible that this could <em>weaken</em> your security if the
   hashing algorithm has fixed points or cycles, that is, values where the
   input to the hashing function equals the output from the hashing function.
   Extending the number of iterations may make it <em>more</em> likely that a
   fixed point or cycle is struck.  (Read Donald Knuth's amusing anecdote
   about fixed points in his homemade random number generator in Volume 2 of
   <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> about how easy it can be to strike
   fixed points. <i>(Legal links, anyone?)</i>) More research is warranted.
   <b>Update:</b> I did more research in the technical note below.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
   <p><b>Technical Note:</b> I decided to do the math on this, to estimate the
    probability of a hash cycle or collision with highly-iterated hashing.  If
    we can assume that the output of the hash function is approximately random
    with respect to the input, (that's a rather strong assumption,) the
    mathematics of the problem reduce to an analog to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Problem</a>
    (that is, the probability that at least one birthday is shared by at least
    2 people in of a group of <code>n</code> people.)
   </p>

   <p>
    The probability <code>p</code> of a cycle with <code>n</code> iterations
    and <code>states</code> states in the hash function can be estimated by:
   </p>

   <p class="code">
    <code class="input">p(n, states) = 1 - e<sup>(-n)(n-1)/(2 * states)</sup></code>
   </p>

   <p>
    Since the argument of the exponent is often a very small number, due to
    the number of states being very high, (2<sup>128</sup> for MD5,
    2<sup>160</sup> for SHA-1, 2<sup>512</sup> for SHA-512,) we will have to
    use an arbitrary-precision exponential function and extended precision in
    many environments.  Below is a <a href="https://frinklang.org/">Frink</a> program (a programming
    language that I wrote) that calculates the probabilities.
   </p>

   <p class="code">
    <code class="input">use <a href="https://frinklang.org/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=ArbitraryPrecision.frink">ArbitraryPrecision.frink</a><br>
     setPrecision[200]<br>
     p[n, states] := 1 - arbitraryExp[((-n)(n-1)/(2 * states))]
    </code>
   </p>

   <p>
    This function can then be called as follows (for the SHA-1 function with
    2<sup>160</sup> states and 65 million iterations):
   </p>

   <p class="code">
    <code class="input">p[65 million, 2^160]</code><br>
    <code class="output">1.445e-33</code><br>
   </p>

   <p>
    Thus, we can derive the following probabilities of hitting a cycle in
    various hash functions, <em>assuming</em> they're close to random:
   </p>

   <table border="0" summary="Hash Collision Probabilities" cellpadding="5">
     <tbody><tr><th>Hash Function</th><th>Bits</th><th>Bytes</th><th>Cycle probability in 65 million iterations
     </th></tr><tr><td>MD5</td><td>128</td><td>16</td><td>6.2*10<sup>-24</sup>
     </td></tr><tr><td>SHA-1</td><td>160</td><td>20</td><td>1.4*10<sup>-33</sup>
     </td></tr><tr><td>SHA-224</td><td>224</td><td>28</td><td>7.8*10<sup>-53</sup>
     </td></tr><tr><td>SHA-256</td><td>256</td><td>32</td><td>1.8*10<sup>-62</sup>
     </td></tr><tr><td>SHA-384</td><td>384</td><td>48</td><td>5.4*10<sup>-101</sup>
     </td></tr><tr><td>SHA-512</td><td>512</td><td>64</td><td>1.6*10<sup>-139</sup>
   </td></tr></tbody></table>

   <p>
    Thus, the probability of seeing a random hash cycle with the SHA-512
    procedure above are so low (given our assumptions!) that we can estimate
    that it won't happen in the lifetime of anyone on the planet living today,
    and we can proably safely assume that using many iterations, as noted
    above, will probably improve our security.  <i>QED.</i>
   </p>

   <p>
    <i>Note:</i> I'm also running homemade programs that are attempting to
    find cycles in iterated MD5 hashes.  It builds a giant hash table of the
    last 100 million hashes it has seen, and will detect any cycle shorter
    than this.  It's not likely I'll find one if the hashing function is
    designed well.

   If, for some reason, you want to back up your secret key and possibly print
   it, you can use the <code>--export-secret-key --armor</code> option to
   <code>gpg</code>, possibly using the <code>--output <i>filename</i></code>
   option to output to a specified file.  Then you could, say, engrave that
   onto a piece of metal and store it away in a cave for 1000 years.  Or
   whatever.  It will be ponderous and error-prone to type that key back in,
   especially with a large key or a key that contains a photo.

   <b>Warning:</b> Read this whole section before making any decision.  This
   section is actually a warning <em>against</em> these practices, rather than
   a recommendation.
  </p>

  <p>
   Alex Cabal has a document entitled <a href="https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/" target="_blank">"Creating the perfect GPG keypair"</a> (Link opens in new
   window) in which he describes creating subkeys of your keypair that you can
   use on a device like your laptop, which somewhat mitigates the risk of your
   laptop being stolen.  In short, it allows you to create a new subkey that
   is used only for signing, which you keep on that laptop.  If the laptop is
   stolen, you can revoke that signing key which is claimed to prevent the
   thief from impersonating you.  However, <em>I think that this practice is
   very dangerous, if not outright wrong.</em> There are good tips about
   managing secret keys in this document, but I argue against its primary
   premise.
  </p>

  <p>
   You should be most strongly warned that these practices will leave your
   communications wide open for interception.  The document linked above does
   not warn you <em>in the strongest possible terms</em> that the practice of
   creating the "perfect key" lets whoever stole your laptop decrypt and
   forever continue to decrypt all your email (if they can guess the password
   used to encrypt your secret key) yet you go on blithely pretending they
   can't!  That is very poor practice.  All that the subkey business does is
   prevent the attacker from <em>impersonating</em> you by signing messages.
   (But, again, <em>only</em> if they can guess the password used to encrypt
   your secret key, and only if your recipients know that you've revoked the
   key.)  If they can guess your password, the attacker could still read
   <em>all</em> your encrypted messages <em>forever</em>.  Read on.
  </p>

  <p>
   Unless everyone that you communicate with <em>regularly</em> does something
   like:
  </p>

   <p class="code">
    <code class="input">gpg --refresh-keys</code>
   </p>

  <p>
   to find out that keys have been revoked, they may never even <em>know</em>
   that you revoked the signing key, and they will continue to trust your
   signature.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the person who stole your laptop (and thus your secret keys) could
   <em>ever</em> impersonate you (because they guessed the password for your
   secret key), then they can <em>forever</em> decrypt all the
   communications sent to you with that same key if you follow the "perfect
   keypair" advice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Allowing your attacker to read your encrypted communications forever, and
   pretending it didn't happen, is extremely bad and wrong cryptographic
   practice, obviously.  If your decryption key is stolen, <em>revoke that
   entire keypair and never use any part of it again</em>!  Otherwise, your
   attacker can forever read messages encrypted to your public key.
  </p>

  <p>
   It appears that the primary benefit of following this procedure is not
   having to rebuild your web of trust with a new key.  However, how much
   trust should you give to someone who still uses a key that has been
   knowingly compromised and does not properly protect your communications
   with them?  The answer is none.  None more trust.
